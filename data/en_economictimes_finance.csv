0,0,Abandonment Value,"Definition: Abandonment value is the equivalent cash value of a project if it is liquidated immediately after reducing all debts which need to be repaid.Description: Abandonment value is also known as liquidation value of an asset. The general rule for deciding to discontinue the product is that if the product’s salvage value is greater than the net present value (NPV) of its expected cash flows, the project is abandoned.	It is important for companies to know the profitability of a project and if it is not profitable it is better to discontinue the same. It is an important factor in bankruptcy filings where assets are generally sold at a discount.	Theoretically, the optimal economic life of an asset is 4 years, but the project’s expected cash flows may change over the life of the asset. The company should also estimate the future abandonment values in the initial investment phase. It would help the manager to effectively gauge the optimal economic life of an asset.For example:	A company’s cost of capital is 10%, and the initial investment cost to be incurred at the beginning of the project is Rs 3,50,000. Future cash flows expected in the next 4 years are 2,00,000, 1,50,000, 10,0000 and 50,000.	Now, if we calculate the net present value of each of the cash flows and subtract it with the initial investment value, it still comes out positive, which is Rs 65,067.	Considering the fact that NPV is still greater than zero, the company should continue with the project and not exercise the option."
1,0,Abnormal Rate Of Return,"Definition: Abnormal rate of return or ‘alpha’ is the return generated by a given stock or portfolio over a period of time which is higher than the return generated by its benchmark or the expected rate of return. It is a measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis.Description: The abnormal rate of return on a security or a portfolio is different from the expected rate of return. It is the return generated by a security or a portfolio which is in excess of its benchmark or the return predicted by an equilibrium model such as capital asset pricing model (CAPM).	Abnormal rate of return can either be positive or negative depending on how the security or a fund has performed in comparison to its benchmark. The normal rate of return can be a forecasted return based on model or it can be the return on an index, such as S&P BSE Sensex or 50-share Nifty index.	The abnormal return on an investment is calculated as follows (1):	RAbnormal = RActual – RNormal	An investment's abnormal return could be positive or negative. It essentially measures how the stock or a fund has performed over a given period of time. Abnormal rate of return as a measure of performance is useful to investors as a valuation tool and for comparing returns to market performance (2).	Example:	Suppose a stock ABCD experiences a 30% return in a given year. Analysts expected ABCD to experience a return of 20% for that year. The (positive) abnormal rate of return ABCD is:	30% actual return – 30% projected return = 10% positive abnormal return	ABCD experience a positive abnormal return of 10% during that year."
2,0,Accounts Payable,"Definition: When a company purchases goods on credit which needs to be paid back in a short period of time, it is known as Accounts Payable. It is treated as a liability and comes under the head ‘current liabilities’. Accounts Payable is a short-term debt payment which needs to be paid to avoid default.Description: Accounts Payable is a liability due to a particular creditor when it order goods or services without paying in cash up front, which means that you bought goods on credit. Accounts Payable as a term is not limited to companies. Even individuals like you and me have Accounts Payable.	We consume electricity, telephone, broadband and cable TV network. The bills get generated towards the end of the month or a particular billing period. It means that the service provider gave you some service and sends the bill which needs to be paid by a certain date or else you will default. This becomes Accounts Payable.	Let’s also understand from a company’s point of view. You are a company A who purchases goods from company B on credit. The amount raised needs to be paid back in 30 days.	Company B will record the same sale as accounts receivable and company A will record the purchase as accounts payable. This is because company A has to pay company B.	Under the accounting (Accrual) methodology, this will be treated as a sale even though money has not exchanged hands yet. The accounts department needs to be extremely careful while processing transactions relating to Accounts Payable.	Here, time is the essence considering it is a short term debt which needs to be paid within a specific period of time. Along with that accuracy is the key, which involves the amount that needs to be paid along with the name of the supplier. Accuracy is important because it will impact the company’s cash position."
3,0,Accounts Receivable,"Definition: Accounts Receivable (AR) is the proceeds or payment which the company will receive from its customers who have purchased its goods & services on credit. Usually the credit period is short ranging from few days to months or in some cases maybe a year.Description: The word receivable refers to the payment not being realised. This means that the company must have extended a credit line to its customers. Usually, the company sells its goods and services both in cash as well as on credit.	When a company extends credit to the customer, the sale is realised when the invoice is generated, but the company extends a time period to the customers to pay the amount after some time. The time period could vary from 30-days to a few months.	Account Receivables (AR) are treated as current assets on the balance sheet. Let's understand AR with the help of an example. Suppose you are a manufacturer M/S XYZ Pvt Ltd and you manufacture tyres.	A customer gives you an order of Rs 1,00,000 for 100 tyres. Now, when the invoice is generated for that amount, sale is recorded, but to make the payment the company extends the credit period of 30-days to the customer.	Till that time the amount of Rs 1,00,000 becomes your account receivable because the customer will pay that amount before the period expires. If not, the company can charge a late fee or hand over the account to a collections department.	Once the payment is made, the cash segment in the balance sheet will increase by Rs 1,00,000, and the account receivable will be decreased by the same amount, because the customer has made the payment.	The amount of account receivable depends on the line of credit which the customer enjoys from the company. Usually, this is offered to customers who are frequent buyers."
4,0,Accrual Accounting,"Definition: When transactions are recorded in the books of accounts as they occur even if the payment for that particular product or service has not been received or made, it is known as accrual based accounting. This method is more appropriate in assessing the health of the organisation in financial terms.Description: To understand accrual accounting, let's first understand what we mean when we say the word 'accrual'. Accrual refers to an entry made in the books of accounts related to the recording of revenue or expense paid without any exchange of cash.	The use of accrual accounting is typically useful in businesses where there are a lot of credit transactions or the goods and services are sold on credit, which simply means that there was no exchange of cash.	Let's understand Accrual accounting with the help of an example. Suppose you are a firm M/S ABC Pvt Ltd, and you are using accrual accounting to maintain your books of accounts. Here, any revenue or income which is generated by sales and expenses incurred are recorded as they occur.	If you sell your goods or products on credit, the sale is recorded in the books based on the invoice generated. There is a possibility that you may not have received the payment by cash at that particular point in time.	An expense is occurred or recorded when the raw material is ordered and not when the actual payment is made to the supplier by either cash or cheque. The only drawback of this type of accounting system is that you, as a firm, might end up paying tax on revenues even when you might have not received it (credit).	Under the accrual method of accounting expenses are balanced with revenues on the income statement. It helps give a better picture of the company's financial condition."
5,0,Audit,"Definition: Audit is the examination or inspection of various books of accounts by an auditor followed by physical checking of inventory to make sure that all departments are following documented system of recording transactions. It is done to ascertain the accuracy of financial statements provided by the organisation.Description: Audit can be done internally by employees or heads of a particular department and externally by an outside firm or an independent auditor. The idea is to check and verify the accounts by an independent authority to ensure that all books of accounts are done in a fair manner and there is no misrepresentation or fraud that is being conducted.	All the public listed firms have to get their accounts audited by an independent auditor before they declare their results for any quarter.	Who can perform an audit? In India, chartered accountants from ICAI or The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India can do independent audits of any organisation. CPA or Certified Public Accountant conducts audits in USA.	There are four main steps in the auditing process. The first one is to define the auditor’s role and the terms of engagement which is usually in the form of a letter which is duly signed by the client.	The second step is to plan the audit which would include details of deadlines and the departments the auditor would cover. Is it a single department or whole organisation which the auditor would be covering. The audit could last a day or even a week depending upon the nature of the audit.	The next important step is compiling the information from the audit. When an auditor audits the accounts or inspects key financial statements of a company, the findings are usually put out in a report or compiled in a systematic manner.	The last and most important element of an audit is reporting the result. The results are documented in the auditor’s report."
6,0,Balance Sheet,"Definition: Balance Sheet is the financial statement of a company which includes assets, liabilities, equity capital, total debt, etc. at a point in time. Balance sheet includes assets on one side, and liabilities on the other. For the balance sheet to reflect the true picture, both heads (liabilities & assets) should tally (Assets = Liabilities + Equity).Description: Balance sheet is more like a snapshot of the financial position of a company at a specified time, usually calculated after every quarter, six months or one year. Balance Sheet has two main heads –assets and liabilities.	Let’s understand each one of them. What are assets? Assets are those resources or things which the company owns. They can be divided into current as well as non-current assets or long term assets.	Liabilities on are debts or obligations of a company. It is the amount that the company owes to its creditors. Liabilities can be divided into current liabilities and long term liabilities.	Another important head in the balance sheet is shareholder or owner’s equity. Assets are equal to total liabilities and owners’ equity. Owner’s equity is used when the company is a sole proprietorship and shareholders’ equity is used when the company is a corporation. It is also known as book value of the company.	Let’s understand reporting of a transaction on a balance sheet. If a company XYZ takes a five-year loan from public sector banks for an amount of Rs 5,00,000, it means that the bank will pay the money to XYZ Ltd.	The accounts department will increase the cash component by 5,00,000 on the assets front, and at the same time increase the long term debt account with the same amount, thus balancing both the sides.	If company raises Rs 10,00,000 from investors, then its assets will increase by that amount, as will its shareholder’s equity."
7,0,Balloon Payment,"Definition: Balloon payment is the lump sum payment which is attached to a loan, mortgage, or a commercial loan. This payment is usually made towards the end of the loan period. Balloon payment is higher than what you might be paying towards the loan on a monthly basis.Description: Balloon payment can be a part of both fixed as well flexible interest rate structure. By attaching a balloon payment to a loan, the borrower is able to cut down on the interest payment that is being made on a monthly basis by the borrower. This can only be possible because the entire loan is not amortised. 	The good part about balloon payment is that they have lower initial payments. They are ideal for companies or borrowers who might be facing cash crunch in the short term, but expect the liquidity to improve in the future.	If a loan has a balloon payment then the borrower will be able to save on the interest cost of the interest outflow every month. For example, person ABC takes a loan for 10 years. In this type of loan with no balloon payment, his/her entire loan will be amortised in small monthly payments till the time his/her entire loan is paid.	If there is balloon payment involved then, usually, the entire principal payment is paid in lump sum towards the end of the term. The sum total payment which is paid towards the end of the term is called the balloon payment.	Customers find it convenient to make a balloon payment, especially those who do seasonal jobs and expect strong cash flows before the loan term expires. However, if they are unable to make that payment then they might have to forgo the payment made in the past and return the product or look at refinancing by taking another loan."
8,0,Bankruptcy,"Definition: When an organisation is unable to honour its financial obligations or make payment to its creditors, it files for bankruptcy. A petition is filed in the court for the same where all the outstanding debts of the company are measured and paid out if not in full from the company’s assets.Description: Bankruptcy filing is a legal course undertaken by the company to free itself from debt obligations. Debts which are not paid to creditors in full are forgiven for the owners. Bankruptcy filing varies in different countries.	In India if you file for bankruptcy it will not go down well with your credit rating, which means that it may be tough for you to get a new loan if you plan to start afresh. However, it would save you from any financial trouble.	In the United States there are three main chapters which are followed – Chapter 7, 11, and 13. Let’s understand each of them in detail.	A person or an organisation files for Chapter 7 under the US bankruptcy law in which they liquidate their assets to repay their debt obligations. Filing Chapter 7 means that all collection efforts from all creditors should be stopped at once. 	Chapter 11 under the US bankruptcy law means that a company will attempt to restructure their debts in order to pay the financial obligations. This particular bankruptcy code is for companies only and not for individuals. Chapter 11 shows the intent of the company to pay off its debts which is a good sign. It gives them the chances to remain in business, but at the same time try and work out methods to pay off its debts.	Chapter 13 says that individuals will attempt to restructure their resources or cashflow to pay off debt. Individuals or self-employed persons can file for Chapter 13 but corporations and partnership firms cannot."
9,0,Bill Of Sale,"Definition: A document that signifies that a person or organisation has sold goods to another person or customer is called bill of sale. It is regarded as a legal document and can be used as a valid proof in all legal matters. It also signifies that the ownership of goods has been transferred to another party.Description: Bill of sale, in simple terms, means a document which can be used as a proof to signify a sale. Just like when you go for shopping in a big retail store and you buy clothes, the retailer give you a slip or a bill which will have details of all the clothes that you bought along with their price.	Let’s take it one level higher. A bill of sale is a sale document used for assets which are expensive such as automobiles. It is necessary that the party who is buying a car or any other asset should make sure that the bill of sale is complete and properly signed by both the parties.	It is used in a variety of transactions such as transfer of ownership of title of goods that people own, and for movable and tangible goods as well. It signifies two basic purposes –it confirms that the ownership of the property has been transferred to another person and serves as evidence in the court of law.	A bill of sale serves as a record of that particular sale to a customer. Let’s take an example, that you are selling your car to a prospective buyer. The most important document for you, as a seller, would be the bill of sale because it will have the information of the buyer, date when the car was sold, amount, etc. which confirms that you have sold the car to a particular person."
10,0,Capital Growth,"Definition: Capital growth is the appreciation in the value of an asset over a period of time. It is calculated by comparing the current value, sometimes known as market value of an asset or investment, to the amount paid when you originally bought it.Description: Capital growth can be measured on assets which are owned by promoters or individual(s). In simple words, assets which are in the name of a company or an individual such as equities or real estate.	Capital growth can be applied to a company as well as individuals who own equities or have their own property. Capital appreciation is taxable once the assets are sold.	Let's take the first asset class equities. If an individual buys a stock ABC, 10 years ago for Rs 100, and now the current value of the stocks or its market value is Rs 1,000, it means that your capital has grown 10 times.	While equities have an income component, it is generally seen that high growth companies usually do not pay dividends and instead use the available cash to reinvest in the business.	The reason why they reinvest in the business is simple. The promoters think that they would be able to generate excess returns by reinvesting the cash rather than paying it in the form of dividends to shareholders.	Let's look at another example, where you bought a property for Rs 10,00,000 15 years ago at a prime location in New Delhi. Now, the market value of the same property has increased to Rs 35,00,000.	To calculate capital growth we have to subtract the original price of the property with the market value of the property now.	Capital Growth = (Market value of the property now - original price paid) = 35,00,000-10,00,000 = Rs 25,00,000."
11,0,Cash Accounting,"Definition: Cash accounting is the methodology under which transactions are recorded when they actually happen. For example, income will be recorded when the company receives cash and expenses are recorded when they are actually paid out and not when the bill is raised.Description: There are two basic type of accounting methodologies – one is cash accounting and the other is accrual accounting. Both systems have their own benefits. Cash accounting is beneficial for small companies or organisations and for complex organisational structures accrual accounting is better.	Cash accounting is a system where revenues as well as expenses are realised when they are received or paid out in case of an expense. It is fairly easy to use methodology. Let’s understand it with the help of an example.	If your company ABC receives an order to supply 10 computers on October 10, but you deliver the goods in November, the sale will be recorded in the month of November only and not in the month of October.	Your firm ABC receives cash of Rs 1,00,000 for the sale of 10 computers from company XYZ on November 10. The accountant will record the transaction of a sale on November 10 only, and not on October 10.	Companies record expenses when they are actually paid out. Let’s understand the concept with the help of an example. If your company hires a contractor on November 1 and a bill is raised on that day, but the actual money was paid out on November 15.	Under cash accounting, November 15 would be the date when the transaction will be recorded and not November 1st.	This method is usually used by sole proprietors who have small, cash-based business or are involved in providing service to customers."
12,0,Cash Flow,"Definition: The amount of cash or cash-equivalent which the company receives or gives out by the way of payment(s) to creditors is known as cash flow. Cash flow analysis is often used to analyse the liquidity position of the company. It gives a snapshot of the amount of cash coming into the business, from where, and amount flowing out.Description: As discussed cash flows can either be positive or negative. It is calculated by subtracting the cash balance at the beginning of a period which is also known as opening balance, form the cash balance at the end of the period (could be a month, quarter or a year) or the closing balance.	If the difference is positive, it means you have more cash at the end of a given period. If the difference is negative it means that you have less amount of cash at the end of a given period when compared with the opening balance at the starting of a period.	To analyse where the cash is coming from and going out, cash flow statements are prepared. It has three main categories – operating cash flow which includes day-to-day transactions, investing cash flow which includes transactions which are done for expansion purpose, and financing cash flow which include transactions relating to the amount of dividend paid out to stockholders.	However, the level of cash flow is not an ideal metric to analyse a company when making an investment decision. A Company’s balance sheet as well as income statements should be studied carefully to come to a conclusion.	Cash level might be increasing for a company because it might have sold some of its assets, but that doesn’t mean the liquidity is improving. If the company has sold off some of its assets to pay off debt then this is a negative sign and should be investigated further for more clarification.	If the company is not reinvesting cash then this is also a negative sign because in that case it is not using the opportunity to diversify or build business for expansion."
13,0,Chart Of Accounts,"Definition: Chart of accounts is known as listing of all the accounts specified by an organisation to record transitions in its general ledger. Each account is usually referred by a number sequence which is helpful in identifying the account in the accounting software.Description: To prepare the chart of accounts, the company first has to list out all the accounts used by the business. These accounts should have a unique number which is also known as sequence number. A company can increase or decrease the sub heads in the chart of accounts according to the nature of business.	The size of a chart of account also depends on the size of the company. A company with multiple divisions as well as international operations will have thousands of accounts, compared to a small company with domestic markets who may just need about hundred accounts.	Different businesses will have different account structures which will be used for reporting. For example, a manufacturing firm will have various accounts which will record the costing as well as sale of the products.	Account numbers should be numbered in a logical way which can help in identification. The accounts are numbered keeping in mind the division of the company, account type, and the department. The account number is made up of five digits; some software may not even require number sequence.	Account numbers are very important in the chart of accounts, and a gap is usually given to further add accounts in a specific department. For example, under the head - current assets (account numbers are given from series 10000-16000)	10100 Petty cash fund, 12000 for accounts receivable, 13000 for suppliers, 15500 for prepaid insurance. The gap between the accounts is given so that the company can add account numbers under this specific head if required."
14,0,Chattel Mortgage,"Definition: Chattel mortgage is a loan extended to an individual or a company on a movable property. Here, the ‘chattel’ or the movable personal property which could be a car or a mobile home can be used as a security to extend the loan.Description: Chattel mortgages are secured loans attached to a personal movable property which is used to extend the loan to an individual or a business owner. In the traditional setup, a loan is given to a person based on the security he/she provides which is usually in the form of land, house, etc.	But with chattel mortgage, a loan is extended to a borrower secured by ‘chattel’, in which the bank holds a lien until the entire amount is repaid. Usually, the rate of interest levied on such mortgages is lower. 	Chattel mortgage generally carries a lower rate of interest, flexible payment structure, and thus proves to be better especially for business owners.	Let’s understand chattel mortgage with the help of an example. If you are a contractor involved in repairing job or construction then you would need a vehicle to carry the goods as well as construction material.	One feature of chattel mortgage which differs from consumer loan is that your bank or the mortgage company will secure the loan using the ‘chattel’ or the vehicle which you are planning to purchase. It could be a tow truck or mini-van etc.	The most important advantage to a mortgage company is that assets which are kept as security are movable and can be sold off quickly in an event of a default. Automobiles, yacht or boats, mobile homes or trailers, electronic items, and appliances are all examples of movable property."
15,0,Contingent Liability,"Definition: A contingent liability is defined as a liability which may arise depending on the outcome of a specific event. It is a possible obligation which may or may not arise depending on how a future event unfolds. A contingent liability is recorded when it can be estimated, else it should be disclosed.Description: A contingent liability is a liability or a potential loss that may occur in the future depending on the outcome of a specific event. Potential lawsuits, product warranties, and pending investigation are some examples of contingent liability.	If the amount can be estimated, the company sets aside that amount separately to be paid out when the liability arises. Contingent liability as a term does not apply only to companies, but to individuals as well.	For example, if you took an educational loan of Rs 10,00,000 from your bank to fund your child’s higher studies. That amount could well become a contingent liability if your child fails to make monthly payments after getting a job. You might have to pay the amount because you have taken the loan from your bank.	Let’s understand contingent liability from a company’s point of view. Your company might be in the middle of a lawsuit and your lawyer thinks that the other party has a strong case which could potentially lead to damages worth Rs 10 crore.	In that case, the company would book that amount as contingent liability on its balance sheet. On the other hand, if the lawyer or the legal department thinks that the other party does not have a very strong case in hand. They would advise the firm not to make any provision of a contingent liability.	When the probability of a contingent liability is low then is no journal or even a disclosure is required in the books of accounts."
16,0,Debt Consolidation,"Definition: Debt consolidation means combining more than one debt obligation into a new loan with a favourable term structure such as lower interest rate structure, tenure, etc. Here, the amount received from the new loan is used to pay off other debts.Description: Debt consolidation is used by consumers to pay off a small debt in one go by taking one big loan. By doing this they save on interest as well as the finance cost of the small loan owed by them. The borrower would now have to make one payment instead of making multiple payments to other creditors.	Debt consolidation can happen on debts which are not tied up to an asset. Education loan, amount owed on credit card, personal loan are some examples of unsecured loans which can come under debt consolidation.	There are some steps which borrowers should follow when they are planning to consolidate their debt. Identify your debt(s) obligations, the total amount that you owe the lenders, time period or tenure, apply for a consolidation loan, once you receive the loan pay off other debts, stick to the payment cycle of the consolidated loan.	Let's understand the concept with the help of an example. For instance you have a loan obligation of Rs 3,00,000, which includes a two-year loan of Rs 1,00,000 with an interest rate of 12 per cent. There is another loan of Rs 2,00,000 which carries an interest rate of 10 per cent annually.	The monthly payment for both the loans comes out to be around Rs 11000 which includes a payment of Rs 5170 from loan 1, and another payment of Rs 5830 from loan 2.	The borrower can reach out to debt Consolidation Company to understand the structure. They might be able to lower the easy monthly instalments or EMIs to around Rs 6000, and consolidate both the loans into one. However, in the process the tenure was increased to pay off the loan.	Debt consolidation is used by consumers to pay off a small debt in one go by taking one big loan. By doing this they save on interest as well as the finance cost of the small loan owed by them. The borrower would now have to make one payment instead of making multiple payments to other creditors.	Debt consolidation can happen on debts which are not tied up to an asset. Education loan, amount owed on credit card, personal loan are some examples of unsecured loans which can come under debt consolidation.	There are some steps which borrowers should follow when they are planning to consolidate their debt. Identify your debt(s) obligations, the total amount that you owe the lenders, time period or tenure, apply for a consolidation loan, once you receive the loan pay off other debts, stick to the payment cycle of the consolidated loan.	Let's understand the concept with the help of an example. For instance you have a loan obligation of Rs 3,00,000, which includes a two-year loan of Rs 1,00,000 with an interest rate of 12 per cent. There is another loan of Rs 2,00,000 which carries an interest rate of 10 per cent annually.	The monthly payment for both the loans comes out to be around Rs 11000 which includes a payment of Rs 5170 from loan 1, and another payment of Rs 5830 from loan 2.	The borrower can reach out to debt Consolidation Company to understand the structure. They might be able to lower the easy monthly instalments or EMIs to around Rs 6000, and consolidate both the loans into one. However, in the process the tenure was increased to pay off the loan."
17,0,Debt Finance,"Definition: When a company borrows money to be paid back at a future date with interest it is known as debt financing. It could be in the form of a secured as well as an unsecured loan. A firm takes up a loan to either finance a working capital or an acquisition.Description: Debt means the amount of money which needs to be repaid back and financing means providing funds to be used in business activities. An important feature in debt financing is the fact that you are not losing ownership in the company.	Debt financing is a time-bound activity where the borrower needs to repay the loan along with interest at the end of the agreed period. The payments could be made monthly, half yearly, or towards the end of the loan tenure.	Another important feature in debt financing is that the loan is secured or collateralized with the assets of the company taking the loan. This is usually part of the secured loan. If the loan is unsecured, the line of credit is usually less.	If a company needs a big loan then debt financing is used, where the owner of the company attaches some of the firm’s asset and based on the valuation of those assets, loan is given.	Let’s understand debt financing with the help of an example. If a company requires a loan of Rs 10 crore, it can raise the capital by selling bonds or notes to institutional investors.	Debt financing is an expensive way of raising funds, because the company has to involve an investment banker who will structure big loans in a systematic way. It is a viable option when interest costs are low and the returns are better.	A company undergoes debt financing because they don’t have to put their own capital. But too much debt is also risky and thus, companies have to decide a level (debt to equity ratio) which they are comfortable with."
18,0,Distributive Bargaining,"Definition: Distributive bargaining is a competitive bargaining strategy in which one party gains only if the other party loses something. It is used as a negotiation strategy to distribute fixed resources such as money, resources, assets, etc. between both the parties.Description: Distributive bargaining is also known as zero-sum negotiations because the assets or the resources which need to be distributed are fixed. So, all the negotiations will have to happen by taking that into context.	The ultimate aim, under distributive bargaining approach, is not to come to a win-win kind of situation but that one side wins as much they can. Both parties will try to get the maximum share from the asset or resource which needs to be distributed.	We end up using distributive bargaining approach in our daily lives as well when we shop. Usually distributive bargaining approach works well with products which do not have a fixed price.	For example, if you go to the supermarket and buy some products, you won't be able to bargain because they have a fixed price. Either you can buy the product or leave it.	Let's understand distributive bargaining approach with the help of another example. You go to Lajpat Nagar market in New Delhi to buy a rug. You are visiting the shop for the first time and	if the rug is of adequate quality, both the parties might not see each other again. The shopkeeper will quote you one price, rather than any lower rate as suggested by you.	In distributive bargaining approach, both the parties try to know each other's walk-away-value to take a decision. After that, they make a deal in that it is closer to their own goal rather than adjusting according to the competitors.	In case the rug cost you Rs 1000, and you give a counter offer of Rs 800. The shopkeeper loses Rs 200. He/she would try to limit the loss and try selling the at around Rs 900-950."
19,0,Due Diligence,"Definition: Due diligence is the process of examining all the material facts of a contract or a deal before a legal contract is signed by both the parties. Put differently, it could also mean verifying the accuracy of a statement.Description: The term, due diligence can be used in a lot of contexts, but it is generally used in reference to business transactions (mostly mergers and acquisitions, joint venture, project finance, securitization, etc.). 	The scope of due diligence typically depends on the nature of transaction proposed to be undertaken. It is not limited to buyers, but even sellers can perform a due diligence on the buyer.	It consists of background, legal, accounting and factual checks. The basic reason for doing such an exercise is to make sure that there are no surprises after the deal is signed.	Companies also do due diligence when a business is looking to add a vendor, purchase commercial property or hire a new employee. The information that is collected after the process is reviewed to make a final decision.	Either parties do due diligence after both the seller and the buyer have agreed in principle to a deal, but before they have signed a binding agreement.	Due diligence also helps in understanding the seller's reasons for selling their business. The information that gets collected in the process is highly sensitive and confidential.	As part of the due diligence process, the party who is investing the money should also review the business' fixed and intangible assets. Knowing exactly what's for sale will help the buyer in valuing the business accurately."
20,0,Equity Finance,"Definition: Equity finance is a method of raising fresh capital by selling shares of the company to public, institutional investors, or financial institutions. The people who buy shares are referred to as shareholders of the company because they have received ownership interest in the company.Description: Equity financing is a method of raising funds to meet liquidity needs of an organisation by selling a company's stock in exchange for cash. The portion of the stake will depend on the promoter's ownership in the company.	One of the most sought after methods of raising cash, apart from public issue, is via Venture Capital. Venture Capital (VC) financing is a method of raising money via high net worth individuals who are looking at diverse investment opportunities.	They provide the company with much needed capital to sustain business in exchange of shares or ownership in the company. 	A start-up might need various rounds of equity financing to meet liquidity needs. They (VC) may like to go for convertible preference share as form of equity financing, and as the firm grows and reports profit consistently, it may consider going public.	If the company decides to go public, these investors (Venture Capitalists) can use the opportunity to sell their stake to institutional or retail investors at a premium. If the company needs more cash, it can go for right offer or follow on public offerings.	When a company goes for equity financing to meet its liquidity needs, for diversification or expansion purpose, it has to prepare a prospectus where financial details of the company are mentioned. The company has to also specify as to what it plans to do with the funds raised.	Equity financing is slightly different from debt financing, where funds are borrowed by the business to meet liquidity requirement. Ideally, to meet liquidity needs an organisation can raise funds via both equity as well as debt financing."
21,0,Factoring,"Definition: Factoring is a type of finance in which a business would sell its accounts receivable (invoices) to a third party to meet its short-term liquidity needs. Under the transaction between both parties, the factor would pay the amount due on the invoices minus its commission or fees.Description: In order to meet short-term liquidity needs, a business has to sometimes resort to factoring. It is slightly different from invoice financing. There are four main types of factoring - maturity factoring, finance factoring, discount factoring, and undisclosed factoring.	The terms, as well as the nature of factoring, could differ from financial institution. The advance rate could vary from 80 per cent to about 90-95 per cent of the total invoice amount. Once the factor collects payments from the creditors, it pays back the rest of the money after deducting its fee or commission.	The only benefit of factoring is that a company doesn't have to wait for two or three months and can address its liquidity needs by approaching a financial institution.	Let's understand factoring with the help of an example. You own a business and you have accounts receivable pending with you which will be due after three months. But in the meantime you need access to cash to address immediate liquidity needs.	To gain access to cash, you approach a factor or a financial institution who has agreed to purchase your invoice worth Rs 10,00,000 from ABC Ltd. The factor may choose to discount the invoice at 4 per cent and will keep RS 40,000 as part of his/her commission. The balance amount is Rs 9,60,000.	Now, the factor might not advance the entire amount of Rs 9,60,000. It would only give around 75 per cent of that which is Rs 7,20,000 in the first tranche and the rest (Rs 2,40,000) when the financial institution receives balance payment from the customer."
22,0,Fully Drawn Advance,"Definition: Fully drawn advance is a financing method which gives you the freedom to take funds or a loan but only for longer durations. It is an ideal way of financing assets which have a long shelf life such as real estate or a manufacturing plant and equipment, etc.Description: Fully drawn advance allows a business owner to get access to instant cash which could be repaid back on the agreed and predetermined schedule along with interest. In this type of advance, the interest rate charged could be flexible or fixed but the loan is usually secured.	This type of loan is extended for a fixed period only. The full amount is given at the beginning of the loan. Usually, commercial banks and finance companies give out these loans.	This type of advance is more suited for individual owners as well as for partnership firms and big organisations. The lenders can work on a payment schedule which could be monthly, quarterly, yearly or after six months.	Credit cards, invoice financing, overdraft facilities extended by the bank, and line of credit are different types of ways a company access funds. When a company requires funds for a short term then invoice financing is a good option. Here, the customer can get access to funds based on the invoices generated by the company. 	An advantage of fully drawn advance with a fixed rate of interest is that the payment structure is known and remains the same till the loan is paid out in full. The rate of interest charged is comparatively less than in variable rate of interest loan.	The only disadvantage is that if your bank decides to decrease the rate of interest you will not get the benefit because you have opted for fixed rate of interest.	Fully drawn advance allows a business owner access to instant cash which could be repaid back on the agreed predetermined schedule along with interest."
23,0,Invoice Finance,"Definition: Invoice financing is a form of short term borrowing which is extended by the bank or a lender to its customers based on unpaid invoices. Invoice financing is often carried out to meet short-term liquidity needs of the company.Description: Invoice financing allows the company or a firm to meet its short-term liquidity needs based on the invoices generated which are still unpaid by its customers. Unpaid invoices are accounts receivable, which means that the company will receive that amount but at a later date. 	If the company faces a liquidity crunch in that period, it has the option to go for invoice financing to meet its liquidity requirement. The company can use the cash to pay employees or suppliers, or invest in getting new machinery, etc.	The benefit of invoice financing is that the company doesn't have to wait for accounts receivable to come and then start paying its employees, buy equipment, etc. They can do that as and when they get the money from the bank or lender.	One important feature to understand in invoice financing is that if the company fails to make payment to the bank/lender, it can use the invoice as collateral. Invoice financing can be done in two distinct ways - one is factoring and the other one is discounting.	Factoring is an arrangement in wherein a company approaches a financier or a bank to sell unpaid invoice. The lender may pay up to 75 per cent of what the invoices are worth up-front to the company. If the lender receives full payment from customers, it will repay the balance amount less interest or other charges back to the company.	Discounting is a method in which the company could get as much as 90 per cent of what the invoices are worth. The only difference between factoring and discounting is that the business collects the payment from customers and then pays it back to the lender. When client(s) makes the payment to the company, it then repays it back to the lender or the bank minus the fee or interest."
24,0,Open Book Management,"Definition: Open book management (OBM) is defined as empowering every employee of an organisation with required knowledge about the processes, adequate training and powers to make decisions which would help them in running a business. It is all about team work and moving forward collectively.Description: Open book management is defined as one of the most dynamic approaches in running a business. It involves keeping complete transparency with employees, sharing data, training employees to embrace leadership roles as well as sharing financial statements. Research has shown that when companies share distinct details about the organisation with the employees, this process helps them grow faster. Most of the companies where this concept is followed generally figure among the top 10% of the companies. 	When a company shares sensitive information with employees, it leads to better employee-employer relationship, helps build trust and boosts the morale of employees. Open book management approach is about showing employees' the financial statement data and making them believe that every effort of theirs is getting reflected in the overall numbers of the company. This facilitates in building the trust as well as enable companies in retaining employees."
