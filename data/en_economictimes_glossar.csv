0,0,Asset Turnover Ratio,"Definition: Asset turnover ratio is the ratio between the value of a company’s sales or revenues and the value of its assets. It is an indicator of the efficiency with which a company is deploying its assets to produce the revenue. Thus, asset turnover ratio can be a determinant of a company’s performance. The higher the ratio, the better is the company’s performance. Asset turnover ratio can be different from company to company. Usually, it is calculated on an annual basis for a specific financial year.Description: Asset turnover ratio can be calculated by considering the average of the assets held by a company at the beginning of the year and at the end of a financial year and keeping the total number of assets as the denominator. The ratio can be higher for companies in certain sectors than others. For example, the retail sector yields the highest asset turnover ratio. According to a survey the retail sector scored an asset turnover ratio of 2.05 in 2014. Retail companies generally have small asset bases, but high sales volumes. The asset turnover ratio is a key constituent of DuPont analysis, a method the DuPont Corporation began using at some point in the 1920s. DuPont analysis basically breaks down return on equity into three parts, asset turnover, profit margin and financial leverage. The asset turnover ratio can be calculated by dividing the net sales value by the average of total assets.Asset turnover = Net sales value/average of total assetsGenerally, a low asset turnover ratio suggests problems with surplus production capacity, poor inventory management and bad tax collection methods. Low-margin industries always tend to have a higher asset turnover ratio."
1,0,Bailout,"Definition: Bailout is a general term for extending financial support to a company or a country facing a potential bankruptcy threat. It can take the form of loans, cash, bonds, or stock purchases. A bailout may or may not require reimbursement and is often accompanied by greater government oversee and regulations.	The reason for bailout is to support an industry that may be affecting millions of people internationally and could be on the verge of bankruptcy due to prolonged financial crises.Description: Bailout policies come in various forms, the most common being direct loans or guarantees of third-party (private) loans to the rescued entity. These direct loans are often on terms favouring the entity being rescued. Sometimes even direct subsidies are provided to the parties concerned. Stock purchases are also not uncommon.	The government or the financing body places strict requirements such as restructuring of organisation, no dividend payment to shareholders, change of management and in some cases a cap on salaries of executives till a stipulated time period or the repayment of dues. This may also be followed by a temporary relaxation of rules that may impact the accounts of the rescued entity.	Bailouts have several advantages. First, they ensure continued survival of the entity being rescued under difficult economic circumstances. Secondly, a complete collapse of the financial system can be avoided, when industries too big to fail start to crumble. The government in these cases steps in to avoid the insolvency of institutions that are needed for the smooth functioning of the overall markets.	Bailouts also have their disadvantages. Anticipated bailouts encourage a moral hazard by allowing not only promoters but also other stakeholders (customers, lenders, suppliers) to take higher-than-recommended risks in financial transactions. This happens because they start counting on a bailout when things go wrong."
2,0,Balance Of Payment,"Definition: According to the RBI, balance of payment is a statistical statement that shows1. The transaction in goods, services and income between an economy and the rest of the world,2. Changes of ownership and other changes in that economy’s monetary gold, special drawing rights (SDRs), and financial claims on and liabilities to the rest of the world, and3. Unrequited transfers.Description: The transactions in BOP are categorised ina) Current account showing export and import of visibles (also called merchandise) and invisibles (also called non-merchandise). Invisibles take into account services, transfers and income.b) Capital account showing a capital expenditure and income for a country. It gives a summary of the net flow of both private and public investment into an economy. External commercial borrowing (ECB), foreign direct investment, foreign portfolio investment, etc form a part of capital account.c) Errors and omissions: Sometimes the balance of payment does not balance. This imbalance is shown in the BOP as errors and omissions. BOP is compiled using the double entry book keeping system consisting assets and liabilities.Also See: Foreign Exchange Reserves, Base RateWatch the video here:"
3,0,Bank Rate,"Definition: Bank rate is the rate charged by the central bank for lending funds to commercial banks. Description: Bank rates influence lending rates of commercial banks. Higher bank rate will translate to higher lending rates by the banks. In order to curb liquidity, the central bank can resort to raising the bank rate and vice versa.Also See: Base Rate, Call Money Rate"
4,0,Basel Iii,"Definition: The third Basel accord or Basel-III is the cornerstone of banking supervision in the world. Framed by a committee of elite central bankers, the accord provides the guidelines for prudent supervision of banks all over the world and sets the standard for such supervision.Description: Basel-III is third in the series of accords following Basel-I and Basel-II. It was released in December, 2010, in Basel, Switzerland. The accord provides for regulatory benchmark on bank capital adequacy, market liquidity risk and stress testing.	The Basel norms for best practices in the banking industry globally are formulated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), which was formed by the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), based in Basel.	According to the committee, “Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures, developed by the BCBS, to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector.”	The accord was released after the catastrophic financial crisis of 2008, which almost pushed the financial system in the West to a virtual collapse. The accord was formed with three major objectives in mind: to enhance disclosure and transparency in the banking sector, improve the methods of risk management and governance within banks and in the overall financial system, and to increase the banking sector’s ability to absorb the effect of financial and economic stress.	Basel-III is built upon three solid pillars of: minimum regulatory capital requirement based on risk-weighted assets or RWAs, a supervisory review process, and proper market disclosure. Under the Basel-III accord, which is being implemented in India under the guidance of the Reserve Bank of India, Indian banks are required to raise Rs 6,00,000 crore of external capital by 2020 in order to meet the minimum capital adequacy limits.	The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was formed by central bankers of 10 countries in 1974 to increase the understanding of various banking supervision issues and to enhance its quality."
5,0,Base Rate,"Definition: Base rate is the minimum rate set by the Reserve Bank of India below which banks are not allowed to lend to its customers. Description: Base rate is decided in order to enhance transparency in the credit market and ensure that banks pass on the lower cost of fund to their customers. Loan pricing will be done by adding base rate and a suitable spread depending on the credit risk premium.Also See: Foreign Exchange Reserves, Balance of Payment  "
6,0,Brexit,"Definition: It is an abbreviation for the term “British exit”, similar to “Grexit” that was used for many years to refer to the possibility of Greece leaving the Eurozone. Brexit refers to the possibility of Britain withdrawing from the European Union (EU). The country will hold a referendum on its EU membership on June 23.Description: Why the Call for Referendum?	When David Cameron became the prime minister of Britain in 2010 as head of a Conservative Liberal Democrat coalition, he had to withstand pressure about a Europe vote from the pro-exit UK Independence Party and from restive eurosceptics in his own party. Finally, in 2013 he promised an in-out referendum on EU membership if the Conservatives won the 2015 election. He secured an absolute majority in 2015 and hence the referendum.Who is Against Brexit?	1) David Cameron – PM, Britain	2) Mark Carney – Governor, Bank of England	3) George Osborne – Former Chancellor of the exchequer, Britain	4) John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown – Former British PMs	5) Barack Obama – President of the United StatesWho is favouring Brexit:	1) Boris Johnson – London Mayor	2) Nigel Farage – UKIP leader, UK	3) George Galloway – Respect party leader, UK	4) Michael Gove – Justice Secretary, UK	5) Vladimir Putin – President of Russia"
7,0,Broad Money To Reserve Money,"Definition: It is a measure of money multiplier. Money multiplier shows the mechanism by which reserve money creates money supply in the economy. It is again dependent on two variables, namely currency deposit ratio and reserve deposit ratio.  Description: M3 is a measure of broad money and includes currency with the public and deposits. The Reserve Money factor shows the reserve money and includes required reserve and the excess reserves of the banking system. If the reserve requirement as stipulated by the RBI increases, the Reserve Money value will increase and the multiplier will fall. Similarly, if banks keep more money as excess reserves, it will have an adverse effect on the money multiplier.  Also See: Net National Income, Currency Deposit Ratio"
8,0,Call Money Rate,"Definition: Call money rate is the rate at which short term funds are borrowed and lent in the money market. Description: The duration of the call money loan is 1 day.  Banks resort to these type of loans to fill the asset liability mismatch, comply with the statutory CRR and SLR requirements and to meet the sudden demand of funds. RBI, banks, primary dealers etc are the participants of the call money market.  Demand and supply of liquidity affect the call money rate. A tight liquidity condition leads to a rise in call money rate and vice versa.Also See: Base Rate, Exchange Rate"
9,0,Capacity Cost,"Definition: An expenditure or cost incurred by a company in order to expand its business operations. In other words, these are expenses incurred by an organization to increase its capacity to conduct business operations.Description: Capacity costs are fixed in nature. They remain constant even when the level of output varies. This part of a company's expenditure is intended to help expansion and increase activities, or for establishment of premises from where the business operations can be conducted. This expense remains fixed irrespective of the level of business activity.	For any business, it is difficult to avoid costs like insurance, rent payments, property taxes, depreciation on equipment, etc. These are examples of capacity costs. These can be avoided or minimized only by shutting down the business or outsourcing the services.Also See: Fixed Costs, Variable Costs, Semi-Variable Costs, Sunk Costs, Overhead Costs"
10,0,Capital Account,"Definition: Capital account can be regarded as one of the primary components of the balance of payments of a nation. It gives a summary of the capital expenditure and income for a country.Description: The capital expenditure and income is tracked by way of funds in the form of investments and loans flowing in and out of an economy. This account comprises foreign direct investments, portfolio investments, etc. It gives a summary of the net flow of both private and public investment into an economy.	A capital account deficit shows that more money is flowing out of the economy along with increase in its ownership of foreign assets and vice-versa in case of a surplus. The balance of payments contains the current account (which provides a summary of the trade of goods and services) in addition to the capital account which records all capital transactions.Also See: Balance of Payments, Capital Assets, Current Account, Balance of Trade, Foreign Direct Investment"
11,0,Capital Adequacy Ratio,"Definition: Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is the ratio of a bank’s capital in relation to its risk weighted assets and current liabilities. It is decided by central banks and bank regulators to prevent commercial banks from taking excess leverage and becoming insolvent in the process.  Description: It is measured as      	Capital Adequacy Ratio = (Tier I + Tier II + Tier III (Capital funds)) /Risk weighted assets 	The risk weighted assets take into account credit risk, market risk and operational risk. 	The Basel III norms stipulated a capital to risk weighted assets of 8%. However, as per RBI norms, Indian scheduled commercial banks are required to maintain a CAR of 9% while Indian public sector banks are emphasized to maintain a CAR of 12%.Also See: Foreign Exchange Reserves, Balance of Payment"
12,0,Casa,"Definition: CASA stands for Current Account and Savings Account which is mostly used in West Asia and South-east Asia. CASA deposit is the amount of money that gets deposited in the current and savings accounts of bank customers. It is the cheapest and major source of funds for banks. The savings accounts portion pays more interest compared to current accounts.Description: Banks offer mainly two types of accounts. These could be term deposits- like fixed or recurring deposits or non-term deposits - like current or savings accounts.	A term deposit is valid for a fixed period of time and in return the bank pays interest at a fixed rate with the condition that you do not touch the money in the interim. For example, you put in Rs 10,000 in a fixed deposit for a period of seven years and the bank pays you an interest at the rate of 12 per cent per annum.	On the other hand, current and savings accounts are used for daily operations and are valid as long as the customer wants them to be. They have lower interest rates than term deposits depending on the bank’s terms and conditions. For example, in an urban area ICICI Bank pays 4.0 per cent interest on a savings account with cheque book on a minimum balance of Rs 10,000.	Since interest rates are lower than term deposits, CASA is a cheaper source of funds for banks. For this reason, financial experts also look at CASA ratio to understand a bank’s financial health, as the same reflects the bank’s capacity to raise money with lower borrowing costs."
13,0,Cash Reserve Ratio,"Definition: Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) is a specified minimum fraction of the total deposits of customers, which commercial banks have to hold as reserves either in cash or as deposits with the central bank. CRR is set according to the guidelines of the central bank of a country.Description: The amount specified as the CRR is held in cash and cash equivalents, is stored in bank vaults or parked with the Reserve Bank of India. The aim here is to ensure that banks do not run out of cash to meet the payment demands of their depositors. CRR is a crucial monetary policy tool and is used for controlling money supply in an economy.	CRR specifications give greater control to the central bank over money supply. Commercial banks have to hold only some specified part of the total deposits as reserves. This is called fractional reserve banking.Also See: Fractional Reserve System, Reserve Requirements, Central Bank, Monetary Policy, Multiplier, Fractional Reserve BankingThis is how Cash Reserve Ratio works..."
14,0,Catch Up Effect,"Definition: Catch up effect, alternatively called the theory of convergence, states that poor or developing economies grow faster compared to economies with a higher per capita income and gradually reach similar high levels of per capita income. Thus, all economies, over time, may converge in terms of income per head.Description: The catch up effect briefly stated implies that the poorer nations grow much faster because of higher possibilities of growth and over time catch up with the richer countries in terms of per capita income such that the divide between the two gets minimized.	This theory of convergence of incomes is based on the logic of better opportunities of growth available for developing economies like access to technological know how from the developed world and increasing returns to capital, etc.	Empirical evidence suggests that while some developing economies have been able to effectively tap the available advantages to grow faster and catch up with robust economies, this has not been true for a large part of the developing world. The limitations of the theory are based on grounds of social, institutional or political differences, which simultaneously influence growth.Also See: Unconvergence, Increasing Returns to Scale, Per Capita Income, Growth Models"
15,0,Ceteris Paribus,"Definition: This commonly-used phrase stands for 'all other things being unchanged or constant'. It is used in economics to rule out the possibility of 'other' factors changing, i.e. the specific causal relation between two variables is focused.Description: This Latin phrase is generally used for saying 'with other things being the same'. It is particularly crucial in the study of cause and effect relationship between two specific variables such that other relevant factors influencing these are assumed to be constant by the assumption of Ceteris Paribus.	The opposite for this is the phrase 'mutatis mutandis', which states changing some factors that need to be changed. Ceteris paribus is often a fundamental assumption to the predictive purpose of scrutiny.Also See: Change in demand, law of supply, income effect, equilibrium, income effectWatch video: Ceteris Paribus decoded..."
16,0,Clearing Price,"Definition: Clearing price is that price of a commodity or a security at which the market clears a commodity or a security. Quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded and buyers and sellers conduct the trade.Description: A price is a specific monetary value associated with a security or a commodity. Generally, it so happens that sellers expect to get the highest possible price for their product, while buyers want to get it at the lowest possible price.	In such a scenario, a price that settles the transaction so that both the parties are in agreement is called the clearing price. Where this price settles is influenced by various other factors. It can also be referred to as the equilibrium price.	It can be said that the clearing price is equal to a value that is the same as the lowest price a seller is ready to take for his commodity and the highest price a buyer is ready to pay for it. Thus, it becomes the price at which the latest transaction was conducted.Also See: Market price, negotiated market, equilibrium price"
17,0,Comparative Advantage,"Definition: The benefit or advantage of an economy to be able to produce a commodity at a lesser opportunity cost than other entities is referred to as comparative advantage in international trade theory.Description: The principle of comparative advantage is fundamental to determination of the pattern of trade among nations. David Ricardo was the economist who coined this term. Opportunity cost, stated briefly, is the benefit foregone for undertaking an activity. So, if a country has a lesser value for its resources in the alternative use, it can most efficiently employ resources in this activity. This is what comparative advantage means.Example: Two goods are produced, say wine and wheat, using only one input, i.e. labour. Suppose Nation A requires 10 and 5 units of labour to produce one unit of wine and wheat, respectively, whereas, Nation B requires 10 units of labour each. In such a scenario, while Nation B will have to forego 1 unit of wine for production of an additional unit of wheat, Nation A will have to forego only half a unit of wine for the same.	Since Nation A can produce wheat at a lower opportunity cost, therefore its best for it to produce and export it, i.e. specialize in the production of wheat. On the other hand, Nation B has to forego only one unit of wheat for production of additional unit of wine as opposed to a loss of two units of wheat in case of Nation A. Therefore, Nation B must specialize in the production of wine.Also See: Absolute advantage, David Ricardo, competitive advantage, international trade theory"
18,0,Consumer Price Index,"Definition: A comprehensive measure used for estimation of price changes in a basket of goods and services representative of consumption expenditure in an economy is called consumer price index.Description: The calculation involved in the estimation of CPI is quite rigorous. Various categories and sub-categories have been made for classifying consumption items and on the basis of consumer categories like urban or rural. Based on these indices and sub indices obtained, the final overall index of price is calculated mostly by national statistical agencies. It is one of the most important statistics for an economy and is generally based on the weighted average of the prices of commodities. It gives an idea of the cost of living.	Inflation is measured using CPI. The percentage change in this index over a period of time gives the amount of inflation over that specific period, i.e. the increase in prices of a representative basket of goods consumed.Also See: Industrial production index, personal consumption expenditure, producer price index, headline inflation, retail price index, Index-linked bond, consumer packaged goods.Watch the video here:"
19,0,Consumer Surplus,"Definition: Consumer surplus is defined as the difference between the consumers' willingness to pay for a commodity and the actual price paid by them, or the equilibrium price.Description: Total social surplus is composed of consumer surplus and producer surplus. It is a measure of consumer satisfaction in terms of utility.	Graphically, it can be determined as the area below the demand curve (which represents the consumer's willingness to pay for a good at different prices) and above the price line. It reflects the benefit gained from the transaction based on the value the consumer places on the good. It is positive when what the consumer is willing to pay for the commodity is greater than the actual price.	Consumer surplus is infinite when the demand curve is inelastic and zero in case of a perfectly elastic demand curve.Also See: Consumer Theory, Indifference Curve, Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, Inter-Temporal Choice, Utility"
20,0,Contagion,"Definition: In economics and finance, a contagion can be explained as a situation where a shock in a particular economy or region spreads out and affects others by way of, say, price movements.Description: The contagion effect explains the possibility of spread of economic crisis or boom across countries or regions. This phenomenon may occur both at a domestic level as well as at an international level. The failure of Lehman Brothers in the United States is an example of a domestic contagion.	The fundamental underlying this scenario where price movements in one market are resultant of shocks or volatility in the other market is that there is a perfect information flow. With increasing interdependence and correlation between economies, this possibility has increased. While internationally, there could a number of other factors governing trade, which may influence the extent of this contagion effect across geographies.Also See: Domino Effect, Asian Financial Crisis, Country Risk, Boom, Recoup Ling"
21,0,Contractionary Policy,"Definition: A contractionary policy is a kind of policy which lays emphasis on reduction in the level of money supply for a lesser spending and investment thereafter so as to slow down an economy.Description: A nation's central bank uses monetary policy tools such as CRR, SLR, repo, reverse repo, interest rates etc to control the money supply flows into the economy. Such measures are used at high growth periods of the business cycle or in times of higher than anticipated inflation. Discouraging spending by way of increased interest rates and reduced money supply helps control rising inflation. It may also lead to increased unemployment at the same time.	The idea here is to make the opportunity cost of holding money high so that people want to hold and spend less of it. The effectiveness of this policy may vary depending upon the specific spending and investment patterns in any economy.Also See: Contraction, Expansionary Policy, Stabilization Policy, Money Supply, Inflation"
22,0,Cost Benefit Analysis,"Definition: It can be explained as a procedure for estimating all costs involved and possible profits to be derived from a business opportunity or proposal.Description: It takes into account both quantitative and qualitative factors for analysis of the value for money for a particular project or investment opportunity. Benefits to costs ratio and other indicators are used to conduct such analyses.	The objective is to ascertain the soundness of any investment opportunity and provide a basis for making comparisons with other such proposals. All positives and negatives of the project are first quantified in monetary terms and then adjusted for their time-value to obtain correct estimates for conduct of cost-benefit analysis. Most economists also account for opportunity costs of the investment in the project to get the costs involved.Also See: Opportunity Costs, Scarcity, Net Present Value, Earnings Before Interest, Profit After Tax"
23,0,Cost Push Inflation,"Definition: Cost push inflation is inflation caused by an increase in prices of inputs like labour, raw material, etc. The increased price of the factors of production leads to a decreased supply of these goods. While the demand remains constant, the prices of commodities increase causing a rise in the overall price level. This is in essence cost push inflation.Description: In this case, the overall price level increases due to higher costs of production which reflects in terms of increased prices of goods and commodities which majorly use these inputs. This is inflation triggered from supply side i.e. because of less supply. The opposite effect of this is called demand pull inflation where higher demand triggers inflation.	Apart from rise in prices of inputs, there could be other factors leading to supply side inflation such as natural disasters or depletion of natural resources, monopoly, government regulation or taxation, change in exchange rates, etc. Generally, cost push inflation may occur in case of an inelastic demand curve where the demand cannot be easily adjusted according to rising prices.Also See: Demand-Pull Inflation, Wage Price Spiral, Aggregate Demand, Profit Margin"
24,0,Countervailing Duties,"Definition: Duties that are imposed in order to counter the negative impact of import subsidies to protect domestic producers are called countervailing duties.Description: In cases foreign producers attempt to subsidize the goods being exported by them so that it causes domestic production to suffer because of a shift in domestic demand towards cheaper imported goods, the government makes mandatory the payment of a countervailing duty on the import of such goods to the domestic economy.	This raises the price of these goods leading to domestic goods again being equally competitive and attractive. Thus, domestic businesses are cushioned. These duties can be imposed under the specifications given by the WTO (World Trade Organization) after the investigation finds that exporters are engaged in dumping. These are also known as anti-dumping duties.Also See: Import Tariff, Export Subsidy, Trade Sanction, Voluntary Export Restraints, Free Trade Agreements"
25,0,Credit Default Swaps,"Definition: Credit default swaps (CDS) are a type of insurance against default risk by a particular company. The company is called the reference entity and the default is called credit event. It is a contract between two parties, called protection buyer and protection seller. Under the contract, the protection buyer is compensated for any loss emanating from a credit event in a reference instrument. In return, the protection buyer makes periodic payments to the protection seller.	In the event of a default, the buyer receives the face value of the bond or loan from the protection seller. From the seller’s perspective, CDS provides a source of easy money if there is no credit event. CDS was introduced by JP Morgan.Description: Assume that two parties A and B enter in a five-year CDS. In this, A is the protection buyer and B is the protection seller. Let’s assume that the notional principal is Rs 50 crore and the protection buyer agrees to pay 100 basis points annually to the protection seller. If the reference entity does not default, the protection buyer keeps on paying 100bps of Rs 50 crore, which is Rs 50 lakh, to the protection seller every year.	On the contrary, if a credit event occurs, the protection buyer will be compensated fully by the protection seller. The settlement of the CDS takes place either through cash settlement or physical settlement. For cash settlement, the price is set by polling the dealers and a mid-market value of the reference obligation is used for settlement.	There are different varieties of CDS, like binary CDS, basket CDS, contingent CDS and dynamic CDS.	There are different types of credit events such as bankruptcy, failure to pay, and restructuring. Bankruptcy refers to the insolvency of the reference entity. Failure to pay refers to the inability of the borrower to make payment of the principal and interest after the completion of the grace period. Restructuring refers to the change in the terms of the debt contract, which is detrimental to the creditors.	If the credit event does not occur before the maturity of the loan, the protection seller does not make any payment to the buyer. CDS can be structured either for the event of shortfall in principal or shortfall in interest. There are three options for calculating the size of payment by the seller to the buyer.	Fixed cap: The maximum amount paid by the protection seller is the fixed rate.	Variable cap: The protection seller compensates the buyer for any interest shortfall and the limit set is Libor plus fixed pay.	No cap: In this case, the protection seller has to compensate for shortfall in interest without any limit.	The modelling of the CDS price is based on modelling the probability of default and recovery rate in the event of a credit event.	The value of CDS for the protection buyer = Expected present value of the contingent leg – Expected present value of fixed leg	In the real world, modelling of the CDS price is difficult because of the problem in computing default probabilities and default correlation.	Asset-backed securities (ABS) is the most common type of CDS.	Although used for hedging credit risks, credit default swap (CDS) has been held culpable for vitiating financial stability of an economy. This is particularly attributable to the capital inadequacy of the protection sellers. When big protection sellers are inadequately capitalised, the over-the-counter (OTC) CDS market raises its ugly head. 	Counter-party concentration risk and hedging risk are the major risks in the CDS market. "
26,0,Cross Elasticity Of Demand,"Definition: The measure of responsiveness of the demand for a good towards the change in the price of a related good is called cross price elasticity of demand. It is always measured in percentage terms.Description: With the consumption behavior being related, the change in the price of a related good leads to a change in the demand of another good. Related goods are of two kinds, i.e. substitutes and complementary goods. In case the two goods are not related, the Coefficient of Cross Elasticity is zero.	In case the two goods are substitutes for each other like tea and coffee, the cross price elasticity will be positive, i.e. if the price of coffee increases, the demand for tea increases. On the other hand, in case the goods are complementary in nature like pen and ink, then the cross elasticity will be negative, i.e. demand for ink will decrease if prices of pen increase or vice-versa.Watch the video to learn more about Cross Elasticity of DemandAlso See: Elasticity, Microeconomics, Consumer Theory, Income Elasticity of Demand, Price Elasticity of Demand, Demand Elasticity"
27,0,Crowding Out Effect,"Definition: A situation when increased interest rates lead to a reduction in private investment spending such that it dampens the initial increase of total investment spending is called crowding out effect.Description: Sometimes, government adopts an expansionary fiscal policy stance and increases its spending to boost the economic activity. This leads to an increase in interest rates. Increased interest rates affect private investment decisions. A high magnitude of the crowding out effect may even lead to lesser income in the economy.	With higher interest rates, the cost for funds to be invested increases and affects their accessibility to debt financing mechanisms. This leads to lesser investment ultimately and crowds out the impact of the initial rise in the total investment spending. Usually the initial increase in government spending is funded using higher taxes or borrowing on part of the government.Also See: Finance, Government Spending, Investment Spending, Keynesian Economics, True Economics"
28,0,Currency Deposit Ratio,"Definition: The currency deposit ratio shows the amount of currency that people hold as a proportion of aggregate deposits.  Description: An increase in cash deposit ratio leads to a decrease in money multiplier.  An increase in deposit rates will induce depositors to deposit more, thereby leading to a decrease in Cash to Aggregate Deposit ratio. This will in turn lead to a rise in Money Multiplier.Also See: Currency Deposit Ratio, Broad Money to Reserve Money  "
29,0,Current Account,"Definition: Current account is one of the two component accounts of the balance of payments of a nation. It records the trade of goods and services of an economy with other countries of the world.Description: Current account includes three components - net exchange i.e. exports minus imports of goods, net exchange of services and net transfers to and from the country. The balance in this account before accounting for the transfer component is generally referred to as the balance of trade. In India, current account is reported by the Reserve Bank of India.	The exchange of goods and services is recorded for the current period and hence is called current account. The current account figure reveals the pattern of foreign trade. If the balance of trade is negative, then the country is importing more goods and services than its exports of these. The other component of the BOP is the capital account.Also See: Current Account Deficit, Capital Account, Balance of Trade, Balance of Payments, Net Borrower, Unilateral Transfers"
30,0,Deadweight Loss,"Definition: It is the loss of economic efficiency in terms of utility for consumers/producers such that the optimal or allocative efficiency is not achieved.Description: Deadweight loss can be stated as the loss of total welfare or the social surplus due to reasons like taxes or subsidies, price ceilings or floors, externalities and monopoly pricing. It is the excess burden created due to loss of benefit to the participants in trade which are individuals as consumers, producers or the government.Example: if a certain tax is imposed on the producer for each unit of the good he sells, it is likely that the new equilibrium price that is settled for the transaction will be higher and therefore some burden of this will be passed on to the consumer.	This will lead to reduced trade from both sides. The loss of welfare attributed to the shift from earlier to this less efficient market mechanism is called the deadweight loss of taxation. This leads to wastage or underutilization of resources due to inefficient market outcomes.Also See: Economic Efficiency, Equilibrium, Indifference Curve, Deadweight Loss of Taxation"
31,0,Debt Equity Ratio,"	(##include msid=4006719,type=11 ##)Definition: The debt-equity ratio is a measure of the relative contribution of the creditors and shareholders or owners in the capital employed in business. Simply stated, ratio of the total long term debt and equity capital in the business is called the debt-equity ratio.	It can be calculated using a simple formula:Description: This financial tool gives an idea of how much borrowed capital (debt) can be fulfilled in the event of liquidation using shareholder contributions. It is used for the assessment of financial leverage and soundness of a firm and is typically calculated using previous fiscal year's data.	A low debt-equity ratio is favorable from investment viewpoint as it is less risky in times of increasing interest rates. It therefore attracts additional capital for further investment and expansion of the business.Also See: Long-Term Debt, Debt Ration, Benefits to Costs Ratio, Return on Debt, Effective Debt, Long-Term Debt to Capitalization Ratio"
32,0,Deflation,"Definition: When the overall price level decreases so that inflation rate becomes negative, it is called deflation. It is the opposite of the often-encountered inflation.Description: A reduction in money supply or credit availability is the reason for deflation in most cases. Reduced investment spending by government or individuals may also lead to this situation. Deflation leads to a problem of increased unemployment due to slack in demand.	Central banks aim to keep the overall price level stable by avoiding situations of severe deflation/inflation. They may infuse a higher money supply into the economy to counter- balance the deflationary impact. In most cases, a depression occurs when the supply of goods is more than that of money.	Deflation is different from disinflation as the latter implies decrease in the level of inflation whereas on the other hand deflation implies negative inflation.Also See: Inflation, Reflation, Stagflation, Agflation, Disinflation, HyperdeflationWatch the video here:"
33,0,Depreciation,"Definition: The monetary value of an asset decreases over time due to use, wear and tear or obsolescence. This decrease is measured as depreciation.Description: Depreciation, i.e. a decrease in an asset's value, may be caused by a number of other factors as well such as unfavorable market conditions, etc. Machinery, equipment, currency are some examples of assets that are likely to depreciate over a specific period of time. Opposite of depreciation is appreciation which is increase in the value of an asset over a period of time.	Accounting estimates the decrease in value using the information regarding the useful life of the asset. This is useful for estimation of property value for taxation purposes like property tax etc. For such assets like real estate, market and economic conditions are likely to be crucial such as in cases of economic downturn.Also See: Accretion, Accelerated Depreciation, Appreciation, Economic Depreciation, Economic LifeLearn more about Depreciation"
34,0,Depression,"Definition: Depression is defined as a severe and prolonged recession. A recession is a situation of declining economic activity. Declining economic activity is characterized by falling output and employment levels. Generally, when an economy continues to suffer recession for two or more quarters, it is called depression.Description: The level of productivity in an economy falls significantly during a depression. Both the GDP (gross domestic product) and GNP (gross national product) show a negative growth along with greater business failures and unemployment.	When a recession continues to take its toll on any economy, the built in process triggers further cuts in investment as well as consumption spending due to loss of confidence among investors and consumers. Also, the financial crisis may lead to decreased availability for credit. Excessive fluctuations happen in relative value of currency. Overall trade and commerce get reduced. The Great Depression of 1929 is considered to be the most classic example of a depression in economic history.Also See: Deflation, Stagflation, Agflation, Great Depression, Economic Stimulus, Contraction"
35,0,Dividend Signaling,"Definition: This is a theory which asserts that announcement of increased dividend payments by a company gives strong signals about the bright future prospects of the company.Description: An announcement of an increase in dividend pay out is taken very positively in the market and helps building a very positive image of the company regarding the growth prospects and stability in the future.	Generally, dividend signaling is done by the company when it changes the amount of dividend to be paid to shareholders."
36,0,Domestic Institutional Investors (diis),"Definition: Domestic institutional investors are those institutional investors which undertake investment in securities and other financial assets of the country they are based in.Description: Institutional investment is defined to be the investment done by institutions or organizations such as banks, insurance companies, mutual fund houses, etc in the financial or real assets of a country. Simply stated, domestic institutional investors use pooled funds to trade in securities and assets of their country.	These investment decisions are influenced by various domestic economic as well as political trends. In addition to the foreign institutional investors, the domestic institutional investors also affect the net investment flows into the economy.Also See: Foreign Institutional Investors, SEBI, Mutual Funds, Hedge Funds, Banks, Insurance Companies, BSE, NSE, Capital Market Segment, Capital Inflows"
37,0,Due Date Rate,"Definition: Due date, also known as maturity date, is the day when some accruals fall due. Due date rate is the amount of debt that has to be paid on a date decided in the past. It can also be known as maturity date rate. If the due date amount is higher than the actual amount, then it results in profit, otherwise it’s a loss.Description: Due date rate, also called maturity amount, is the amount of debt that a debtor has to pay on a date decided earlier. For example, if a person named ABC borrowed Rs 100 from someone called XYZ and it has been decided that ABC would pay Rs 110 on a date decided at the time of making the transaction, then Rs 110 is called the due date rate, maturity amount or maturity rate and the date is a called the due date or maturity date.	Due date amount is also calculated widely for bank deposits, FDs, NSCs, and other investment instruments and via financial institutions. The due date amount/rate for a fixed deposit of Rs 10,000 with 10 per cent annual rate of interest for one year will be Rs 11,000.	The difference between the principle and due date rate can be determined as profit/loss. If the due date rate is higher than the actual rate, the difference amount is called profit, otherwise it will be treated as loss."
38,0,Ease Of Doing Business,"Definition: Ease of doing business is an index published by the World Bank. It is an aggregate figure that includes different parameters which define the ease of doing business in a country.  Description: It is computed by aggregating the distance to frontier scores of different economies. The distance to frontier score uses the ‘regulatory best practices’ for doing business as the parameter and benchmark economies according to that parameter. 	For each of the indicators that form a part of the statistic ‘Ease of doing business,’ a distance to frontier score is computed and all the scores are aggregated. The aggregated score becomes the Ease of doing business index.   	Indicators for which distance to frontier is computed include construction permits, registration, getting credit, tax payment mechanism etc. Countries are ranked as per the index.   Also See: Benchmark Government Bond, Real GDP at Factor Cost"
39,0,Emi,"Definition: EMI or equated monthly installment, as the name suggests, is one part of the equally divided monthly outgoes to clear off an outstanding loan within a stipulated time frame.Description: The EMI is dependent on multiple factors, such as:	1) Principal borrowed	2) Rate of interest	3) Tenure of the loan	4) Monthly/annual resting period	For a fixed interest rate loan, the EMI remains fixed for the entire tenure of the loan, provided there is no default or part-payment in between. The EMI is used to pay off both the principal and interest components of an outstanding loan. The first EMI has the highest interest component and the lowest principal component. With every subsequent EMI, the interest component keeps on reducing while the principal component keeps rising. Thus, the last EMI has the highest principal component and the lower interest component.	In case the borrower makes a pre-payment through the tenure of a running loan, either the subsequent EMIs get reduced or the original tenure of the loan gets reduced or a mix of both. The reverse happens when the borrower skips an EMI through the tenure of the loan (EMI holiday or cheque dishonor/bounce or insufficient balance in case of auto deduction of EMI or a default); in that case either the subsequent EMIs rise or the tenure of the loan increases or a mix of both, apart from inviting a financial penalty, if any.	Similarly, in case the rate of interest reduces through the tenure of the loan (as in the case of floating rate loans) the subsequent EMIs get reduced or the tenure of the loan falls or a mix of both. The reverse happens when the rate of interest rises.	Suppose a person borrows Rs 1 lakh for one year at the fixed rate of 9.5 per cent per annum with a monthly rest. In this case, the EMI for the borrower for 12 months (1 year X 12 months = 12 months) works out to approximately Rs 8,768. The monthly payment schedule works out as follows:"
40,0,Etf,"Definition: ETFs or exchange traded funds are similar to index mutual funds. However, they trade just like stocks.Description: ETFs were started in 2001 in India. They comprise a portfolio of equity, bonds and trade close to its net asset value. These funds mainly track an index, a commodity, or a pool of assets.	They have the following advantages over mutual funds and equity/debt funds:	1. Lower Costs: An investor who buys an ETF doesn't have to pay an advisory/management fee to the fund manager and taxes are relatively lower in ETFs.	2. Lower Holding Costs: As commodity ETFs are widely traded in, there isn't any physical delivery of commodity. The investor is just provided with an ETF certificate, similar to a stock certificate.Also See: Mutual Funds, Hedge Funds, Gold ETF, Index Funds"
41,0,Exchange Rate,"Definition: Exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another currency.Description: Exchange rates can be either fixed or floating. Fixed exchange rates are decided by central banks of a country whereas floating exchange rates are decided by the mechanism of market demand and supply.Also See: Base Rate, Call Money Rate"
42,0,Fair Trade Price,"Definition: In the commodities market, fair trade price is the minimum price that importers must pay to the producers of some agricultural products such as coffee and banana. It is the floor price that must be paid irrespective of the market price.	When the market price of a commodity is higher than this minimum price, the buyer must pay the former. But if the market price falls below the fair trade price, the producer must be paid at least a price equal to the fair trade price.Description: Fair trade price acts as a security net that reduces market risks of farmers and attempts to improve their living conditions. The fair trade price policy comes under the fair trade standards, which stipulate that it is unfair to pay market price to the producers in developing countries if the price is too low to survive and does not provide them at least the cost of production.	The Fair Trade Labelling Organisation international (FLO) monitors the fair trade floor price and changes it from time to time considering the average cost of production, working conditions, and other economic factors.	Products sold at fair trade prices must follow the standards outlined by FLO-CERT and are generally sold at higher prices. They also contain fair trade labels, indicating that the products were produced and traded in agreement with these standards. 	As long as the trade price is above the fair trade price, it allows traders and producers to negotiate higher prices depending on the quality and other attributes.	Fair trade price focuses, in particular, on goods or products that are normally imported from developing countries. They include products such as coffee, handicraft, cocoa, banana, sugar, tea, wine, fresh fruit, chocolate, and flowers."
43,0,Fallout Risk,"Definition: Fallout risk or borrower fallout is one of the two components of pipeline risk, the other being price risk. The risk can simply be defined as the probability of a prospective borrower failing to complete his/her mortgage loan transaction. Usually, a high fallout risk occurs when the finalisation of a mortgage deal is contingent upon another deal, such as the sale of a real estate asset.	It is because if the deal fails to go through, it is said to have fallen out of the lender’s pipeline. Here, pipeline refers to the loan commitment made by the mortgage originator or lender and also the loan application processed. The risk arises when the mortgage originators give potential borrowers the right, but not the obligation, to cancel the agreement.Description: A change in interest rate not only influences the value of the lender’s pipeline risk, it also has a direct bearing on the percentage of loans that will close. By measuring the historical fallout in different market scenarios, lenders can predict the percentage of loans in their pipeline that may close and adjust their hedging strategies accordingly to cut any fallout and maximise profits.	The impact of such a fallout on mortgage originators can vary in case the interest rate rises or falls. If interest rates increase, borrowers are likely to accept the terms and there are more chances that a higher percentage of loans in the pipeline will close. However, if interest rates fall during the lock-in period, borrowers are more likely to tap cheaper sources of funding, resulting in a lower percentage of loans being closed."
44,0,Foreign Exchange Reserves,"Definition: Forex reserves are foreign currency assets held by the central banks of countries. Description: These assets include foreign marketable securities, monetary gold, special drawing rights (SDRs) and reserve position in the IMF.  The main purpose of holding foreign exchange reserves is to make international payments and hedge against exchange rate risks.Also See: Balance of Payment, Base Rate"
45,0,Gross Domestic Saving,"Definition: Gross Domestic Saving is GDP minus final consumption expenditure. It is expressed as a percentage of GDP.  Description: Gross Domestic Saving consists of savings of household sector, private corporate sector and public sector. Gross domestic savings had followed a downward trajectory after 2008. The more concerning issue is the perceptible shift of investors’ preference towards physical assets as compared to financial assets. This can be attributable to a rise in inflationary pressures.  Gross capital formation is a function gross domestic savings.  Also See: Gross National Product  "
46,0,Gross National Product,Definition:  Gross National Product (GNP) is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) plus net factor income from abroad.Description: GNP measures the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced by the country’s factors of production irrespective of their location. Only the finished or final goods are considered as factoring intermediate goods used for manufacturing would amount to double counting. It includes taxes but does not include subsidies.  Also See: Gross Domestic Saving
47,0,Human Development Index,"Definition: The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistical tool used to measure a country's overall achievement in its social and economic dimensions. The social and economic dimensions of a country are based on the health of people, their level of education attainment and their standard of living.Description: Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq created HDI in 1990 which was further used to measure the country's development by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). Calculation of the index combines four major indicators: life expectancy for health, expected years of schooling, mean of years of schooling for education and Gross National Income per capita for standard of living.	Every year UNDP ranks countries based on the HDI report released in their annual report. HDI is one of the best tools to keep track of the level of development of a country, as it combines all major social and economic indicators that are responsible for economic development."
48,0,Hysteresis,"Definition: In economics, hysteresis is a situation which arises when any historical event affects the future economic path. Any disturbance in an economy will lead to a trickle down effect, and the problem will persist for long. This rolling down impact is known as the hysteresis effect.Description: It is a Greek term coined by the Scottish physician and engineer Sir James Elfred Ewing, who explained it as the time gap between the action and reaction of any physical instrument or object.	For instance, the natural rate of unemployment in an economy gets affected by a single historical event, persists for a long period and results in the Hysteresis effect. The long lasting unemployment will cause a loss to the economy in terms of loss of job skills; an unemployed person will adjust himself to a lower standard of living and will not desire to achieve the previous standard of living.	In addition, an increase in the number of unemployed will create a social notion to remain unemployed. The result will be prolonged, will result in structural unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment will rise further. This economic cost to the economy will result in the Hysteresis effect."
49,0,Imperfect Competition,"Definition: Imperfect competition is a competitive market situation where there are many sellers, but they are selling heterogeneous (dissimilar) goods as opposed to the perfect competitive market scenario. As the name suggests, competitive markets that are imperfect in nature.Description: Imperfect competition is the real world competition. Today some of the industries and sellers follow it to earn surplus profits. In this market scenario, the seller enjoys the luxury of influencing the price in order to earn more profits.	If a seller is selling a non identical good in the market, then he can raise the prices and earn profits. High profits attract other sellers to enter the market and sellers, who are incurring losses, can very easily exit the market.There are four types of imperfect markets:	- Monopoly (only one seller) - Oligopoly (few sellers of goods) - Monopolistic competition (many sellers with highly differentiated product) - Monopsony (only one buyer of a product)"
50,0,Indifference Curve,"	(##include msid=4006719,type=11 ##) Definition: An indifference curve is a graph showing combination of two goods that give the consumer equal satisfaction and utility. Each point on an indifference curve indicates that a consumer is indifferent between the two and all points give him the same utility.Description: Graphically, the indifference curve is drawn as a downward sloping convex to the origin. The graph shows a combination of two goods that the consumer consumes.	The above diagram shows the U indifference curve showing bundles of goods A and B. To the consumer, bundle A and B are the same as both of them give him the equal satisfaction. In other words, point A gives as much utility as point B to the individual. The consumer will be satisfied at any point along the curve assuming that other things are constant.Here's how the indifference curve works..."
51,0,Inferior Goods,"	(##include msid=4006719,type=11 ##)Definition: An inferior good is a type of good whose demand declines when income rises. In other words, demand of inferior goods is inversely related to the income of the consumer.Description: For example, there are two commodities in the economy -- wheat flour and jowar flour -- and consumers are consuming both. Presently both commodities face a downward sloping graph, i.e. the higher the price the lesser will be the demand and vice versa. If the income of consumer rises, then he would be more inclined towards wheat flour, which is a little costly than jowar flour.	The mindset of the consumer behind this behavior is that now he can afford wheat flour because of his increase in income. Therefore, he will switch his flour demand from jowar to wheat. Hence jowar, whose demand has fallen due to an increase in income, is the inferior good and wheat is the normal good."
52,0,Inflation,"Definition: Inflation is the percentage change in the value of the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) on a year-on year basis. It effectively measures the change in the prices of a basket of goods and services in a year. In India, inflation is calculated by taking the WPI as base.Formula for calculating Inflation=	(WPI in month of current year-WPI in same month of previous year)	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    X   100	WPI in same month of previous yearDescription: Inflation occurs due to an imbalance between demand and supply of money, changes in production and distribution cost or increase in taxes on products. When economy experiences inflation, i.e. when the price level of goods and services rises, the value of currency reduces. This means now each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services.	It has its worst impact on consumers. High prices of day-to-day goods make it difficult for consumers to afford even the basic commodities in life. This leaves them with no choice but to ask for higher incomes. Hence the government tries to keep inflation under control.	Contrary to its negative effects, a moderate level of inflation characterizes a good economy. An inflation rate of 2 or 3% is beneficial for an economy as it encourages people to buy more and borrow more, because during times of lower inflation, the level of interest rate also remains low. Hence the government as well as the central bank always strive to achieve a limited level of inflation.Watch video: All that you wanted to know about inflation..."
53,0,Infrastructure Investment Trusts,"Definition: An Infrastructure Investment Trust (InvITs) is like a mutual fund, which enables direct investment of small amounts of money from possible individual/institutional investors in infrastructure to earn a small portion of the income as return. InvITs work like mutual funds or real estate investment trusts (REITs) in features. InvITs can be treated as the modified version of REITs designed to suit the specific circumstances of the infrastructure sector.Description: Sebi notified the Sebi (Infrastructure Investment Trusts) Regulations, 2014 on September 26, 2014, providing for registration and regulation of InvITs in India. The objective of InvITs is to facilitate investment in the infrastructure sector.	InvITS are like mutual funds in structure. InvITs can be established as a trust and registered with Sebi. An InvIT consists of four elements: 1) Trustee, 2) Sponsor(s), 3) Investment Manager and 4) Project Manager.	The trustee, who inspects the performance of an InvIT is certified by Sebi and he cannot be an associate of the sponsor or manager.	‘Sponsors’ are people who promote and refer to any organisation or a corporate entity with a capital of Rs 100 crore, which establishes the InvIT and is designated as such at the time of the application made to Sebi, and in case of PPP projects, base developer.	Promoters/sponsor(s), jointly, have to hold a minimum of 25 per cent for three years (at least) in the InvIT, excluding the situations where an administrative requirement or concession agreement needs the sponsor to hold some minimum percent in the special purpose vehicle. In these cases, the total value of the sponsor holding in the primary special purpose vehicle and in the InvIT should not be less than 25 per cent of the value of units of InvIT on post-issue basis.	Investment manager is an entity or limited liability partnership (LLP) or organisation that supervises assets and investments of the InvIT and guarantees activities of the InvIT.	Project manager refers to the person who acts as the project manager and whose duty is to attain the execution of the project and in case of PPP projects. It indicates that the entity is responsible for such execution and accomplishment of project landmark with respect to the agreement or other relevant project document."
54,0,Investment Banking,"Definition: Investment banking is a special segment of banking operation that helps individuals or organisations raise capital and provide financial consultancy services to them.	They act as intermediaries between security issuers and investors and help new firms to go public. They either buy all the available shares at a price estimated by their experts and resell them to public or sell shares on behalf of the issuer and take commission on each share.Description: Investment banking is among the most complex financial mechanisms in the world. They serve many different purposes and business entities. They provide various types of financial services, such as proprietary trading or trading securities for their own accounts, mergers and acquisitions advisory which involves helping organisations in M&As,; leveraged finance that involves lending money to firms to purchase assets and settle acquisitions, restructuring that involves improving structures of companies to make a business more efficient and help it make maximum profit, and new issues or IPOs, where these banks help new firms go public.	Let’s understand how an investment bank earns money by providing acquisition advisories.	Think of company ABC buying another company XYZ. ABC is not sure how much company XYZ is really worth and what will be the long-term benefits in terms of revenues, costs, etc. In this scenario, the investment bank will go through the process of due diligence to determine the value of the company, settle the deal by helping ABC prepare necessary documents and advising it on the appropriate timing of the deal.	Here the investment bank works on the buy side and some other investment banks may be working on the sell side to help XYZ. The bigger the deal size, the more commission the bank will earn.	Bank of America, Barclays Capital, Citigroup Investment Banking, Deutsche Bank, and JP Morgan are some of the largest investment banks in India."
55,0,Invisible Hand,"Definition: The unobservable market force that helps the demand and supply of goods in a free market to reach equilibrium automatically is the invisible hand.Description: The phrase invisible hand was introduced by Adam Smith in his book 'The Wealth of Nations'. He assumed that an economy can work well in a free market scenario where everyone will work for his/her own interest.	He explained that an economy will comparatively work and function well if the government will leave people alone to buy and sell freely among themselves. He suggested that if people were allowed to trade freely, self interested traders present in the market would compete with each other, leading markets towards the positive output with the help of an invisible hand.	In a free market scenario where there are no regulations or restrictions imposed by the government, if someone charges less, the customer will buy from him. Therefore, you have to lower your price or offer something better than your competitor. Whenever enough people demand something, it will be supplied by the market and everyone will be happy. The seller end up getting the price and the buyer will get better goods at the desired price."
56,0,Labour Market,"Definition: A labour market is the place where workers and employees interact with each other. In the labour market, employers compete to hire the best, and the workers compete for the best satisfying job.Description: A labour market in an economy functions with demand and supply of labour. In this market, labour demand is the firm's demand for labour and supply is the worker's supply of labour. The supply and demand of labour in the market is influenced by changes in the bargaining power."
57,0,Law Of Demand,"	(##include msid=4006719,type=11 ##)Definition: The law of demand states that other factors being constant (cetris peribus), price and quantity demand of any good and service are inversely related to each other. When the price of a product increases, the demand for the same product will fall.Description: Law of demand explains consumer choice behavior when the price changes. In the market, assuming other factors affecting demand being constant, when the price of a good rises, it leads to a fall in the demand of that good. This is the natural consumer choice behavior. This happens because a consumer hesitates to spend more for the good with the fear of going out of cash.	The above diagram shows the demand curve which is downward sloping. Clearly when the price of the commodity increases from price p3 to p2, then its quantity demand comes down from Q3 to Q2 and then to Q3 and vice versa.Learn more about the Law of Demand.."
58,0,Law Of Supply,"	(##include msid=4006719,type=11 ##) Definition: Law of supply states that other factors remaining constant, price and quantity supplied of a good are directly related to each other. In other words, when the price paid by buyers for a good rises, then suppliers increase the supply of that good in the market.Description: Law of supply depicts the producer behavior at the time of changes in the prices of goods and services. When the price of a good rises, the supplier increases the supply in order to earn a profit because of higher prices.	The above diagram shows the supply curve that is upward sloping (positive relation between the price and the quantity supplied). When the price of the good was at P3, suppliers were supplying Q3 quantity. As the price starts rising, the quantity supplied also starts rising.Snapshot: This is how the law of supply works..."
59,0,Libor,"Definition: LIBOR, the acronym for London Interbank Offer Rate, is the global reference rate for unsecured short-term borrowing in the interbank market. It acts as a benchmark for short-term interest rates. It is used for pricing of interest rate swaps, currency rate swaps as well as mortgages. It is an indicator of the health of the financial system and provides an idea of the trajectory of impending policy rates of central banks.Description: LIBOR is administered by the Intercontinental Exchange or ICE. It is computed for five currencies with seven different maturities ranging from overnight to a year. The five currencies for which LIBOR is computed are Swiss franc, euro, pound sterling, Japanese yen and US dollar. ICE benchmark administration consists of 11 to 18 banks that contribute for each currency.	The rates received from the banks are arranged in descending order and the top and bottom quartiles are excluded to remove outliers. The arithmetic mean of the remaining data is then computed to get the LIBOR rate. The process is repeated for each of the 5 currencies and 7 maturities, thereby producing 35 reference rates. 3 month LIBOR is the most commonly used reference rate.	Suppose a corporation issued a six-month floating rate note linked to LIBOR. On each coupon date, the coupon amount will be computed as the par value of the note time one half of the 6 month coupon rate quoted 6 months earlier. Assuming that the prior six months, LIBOR rate is 4 per cent and the par value of the note is 100 pounds, the coupon amount at present will be 100time(4%/2) which is equal to 2.	Now, if the 6 month LIBOR rate of the current period changed to 3.25% then the next 6 month coupon will be 100time(3.25%/2) equal 1.625. 	Before ICE, LIBOR was set by British Bankers Association (BBA) but the rigging and manipulation of LIBOR during the financial crisis of 2008 has led the financial market watchdogs to replace the BBA LIBOR with a new administrator. On the basis of Wheatley Review Recommendation, the Hogg Tendering Advisory Committee selected a new entity called the Intercontinental Exchange for the administration of LIBOR. The new administrator became operational from February, 2014. "
60,0,Liquid Asset,"Definition: An asset is said to be liquid if it is easy to sell or convert into cash without any loss in its value. By definition, bank notes and checking accounts are the most liquid assets.Description: A liquid asset allows any individual or a company to access cash at any time they want. At the time of investing, the investor must keep some of the liquid assets in his portfolio so that he can have an easy hand on his money during an emergency.	Cash is a highly liquid asset followed by the banking accounts, checkable account, short-term promissory notes, treasury bills and other government bonds."
61,0,Liquidity,"Definition: Liquidity means how quickly you can get your hands on your cash. In simpler terms, liquidity is to get your money whenever you need it.Description: Liquidity might be your emergency savings account or the cash lying with you that you can access in case of any unforeseen happening or any financial setback. Liquidity also plays an important role as it allows you to seize opportunities.	If you have cash and easy access to fund and a great deal comes along, then it's easier for you to cease that opportunity. Cash, savings account, checkable account are liquid assets because they can be easily converted into cash as and when required.How does Liquidity work? Watch video..."
62,0,Liquidity Trap,"Definition: Liquidity trap is a situation when expansionary monetary policy (increase in money supply) does not increase the interest rate, income and hence does not stimulate economic growth.Description: Liquidity trap is the extreme effect of monetary policy. It is a situation in which the general public is prepared to hold on to whatever amount of money is supplied, at a given rate of interest. They do so because of the fear of adverse events like deflation, war.	In that case, a monetary policy carried out through open market operations has no effect on either the interest rate, or the level of income. In a liquidity trap, the monetary policy is powerless to affect the interest rate.	There is a liquidity trap at short term zero percent interest rate. When interest rate is zero, public would not want to hold any bond, since money, which also pays zero percent interest, has the advantage of being usable in transactions.	Hence, if the interest is zero, an increase in quantity of money cannot not induce anyone to buy bonds and thereby reduce the interest on bonds below zero."
63,0,Macroeconomic Policy,"Definition: The set of government rules and regulations to control or stimulate the aggregate indicators of an economy frames the macroeconomic policy. Aggregate indicators involve national income, money supply, inflation, unemployment rate, growth rate, interest rate and many more. In short, policies framed to meet the macro goals.Description: Two main regulatory macroeconomic policies are fiscal policy and monetary policy. Fiscal policy is the macroeconomic policy where the government makes changes in government spending or tax to stimulate growth. Monetary policy deals with changes in money supply or changes with the parameters that affects the supply of money in the economy.	Contract laws, debt management policy, income policy are some of the other macroeconomic policies designed to modify macroeconomic indicators of the economy."
64,0,Macroeconomics,"Definition: Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the behavior and performance of an economy as a whole. It focuses on the aggregate changes in the economy such as unemployment, growth rate, gross domestic product and inflation.Description: Macroeconomics analyzes all aggregate indicators and the microeconomic factors that influence the economy. Government and corporations use macroeconomic models to help in formulating of economic policies and strategies.Watch the video to learn more about Macroeconomics"
65,0,Marginal Standing Facility,"Definition: Marginal standing facility (MSF) is a window for banks to borrow from the Reserve Bank of India in an emergency situation when inter-bank liquidity dries up completely. 	Description: Banks borrow from the central bank by pledging government securities at a rate higher than the repo rate under liquidity adjustment facility or LAF in short. The MSF rate is pegged 100 basis points or a percentage point above the repo rate. Under MSF, banks can borrow funds up to one percentage of their net demand and time liabilities (NDTL).Also See: Statutory Liquidity Ratio"
66,0,Market Capitalization,"Definition: Market capitalization is the aggregate valuation of the company based on its current share price and the total number of outstanding stocks. It is calculated by multiplying the current market price of the company's share with the total outstanding shares of the company.Description: Market capitalization is one of the most important characteristics that helps the investor determine the returns and the risk in the share. It also helps the investors choose the stock that can meet their risk and diversification criterion.	For instance, a company has 20 million outstanding shares and the current market price of each share is Rs100. Market capitalization of this company will be 200,00,000 x 100=Rs 200 crore.	Stocks of companies are of three types. The stocks with a market cap of Rs 10,000 crore or more are large cap stocks. Company stocks with a market cap between Rs 2 crore and 10 crore are mid cap stocks and those less than Rs 2 crore market cap are small cap stocks."
67,0,Mark To Market,"Definition: Mark-to-market refers to the reasonable value of an account that can vary over a period depending on assets and liabilities. Mark-to-market provides a realistic estimate of a financial situation. It has been a part of the generally accepted accounting principles in the United States since 1990 and it is regarded as gold standards in some areas.	Mark-to-market can also be defined as an accounting tool used to record the value of an asset with respect to its current market price. The mark-to-market principle was largely adopted during the 20th century.Description: Mark-to-market is a tool that can change the value on either side of a balance sheet, depending on the conditions of the market. For example, stocks that an individual holds in his/her demat account are marked to market every day. At the time of closing of market, the price assigned to each stock is the price that buyers and sellers decide at the end of the day.	Many people agree that mark-to-market reflects the true value of an asset as it is decided with respect to the current market price. It can be problematic at times as the value of assets may vary every second due to changing market conditions and because buyers and sellers keep coming in and going out in an irregular fashion.	In mark-to-market, problems may occur when market-based measurements do not give the true value of an underlying asset.	Problems occur mainly when a company or financial institution is forced to calculate selling prices of its assets and liabilities during unfavourable conditions, such as a financial crisis.	Mutual fund schemes and stocks are marked to market on a daily basis."
68,0,Mibor,"Definition: MIBOR is the acronym for Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate, the yardstick of the Indian call money market. It is the rate at which banks borrow unsecured funds from one another in the interbank market. At present, it is used as a reference rate for floating rate notes, corporate debentures, term deposits, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements. The pricing of overnight indexed swaps, a type of overnight interest rate swap used for hedging interest rate risk is based on overnight MIBOR.	Description: Based on the recommendation of the Committee for the Development of Debt Market, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) launched the Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate (MIBOR) and Mumbai Interbank Bid Rate (MIBID) in June, 1998. Subsequently, the NSE developed a benchmark rate for the term money market, like the 14-day, 1-month and 3-month MIBOR. The same was rechristened as FIMMDA-NSE MIBID/MIBOR rate in due course. The rate is computed by polling a representative panel of 30 banks and primary dealers and summarising the quotes that they provided. The next step involves identifying and isolating the noise by eliminating extreme values of the reference rates.	Next, the bootstrapping technique is employed for computing the test statistic, namely the mean reference rate, and confidence intervals for the mean reference rates. Bootstrapping is a non-parametric method and does not make any assumption about the distribution from which the mean reference rate is drawn.	However, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has stipulated that the methodology for computing the FIMMDA-NSE overnight, the MIBOR/MIBID rate will be revised following the introduction of FBIL Overnight MIBOR in July, 2015. The FBIL overnight MIBOR rate will be administered by Financial Benchmarks India, an entity formed by FIMMDA, Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (FEDAI) and Indian Banks Association (IBA). 	The FBIL overnight MIBOR rate computed by the Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) is based on trade-weighted interbank call money transactions on the NDS call platform of CCIL between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. Thus, the reference rate is based on the actual traded rates as opposed to polled rates, which are used to determine the FIMMDA NSE MIBOR/MIBID rates. 	Only T+0 settlement deals are used for the computation of the rate. A minimum of 10 trades with a traded value of Rs 500 crore is considered as the minimum threshold limit for the computation of FBIL overnight MIBOR. The weighted mean reference rate and the standard deviation are calculated for the traded rates. A range of reference rate is computed. The maximum limit is defined as mean + 3 times standard deviation while the minimum limit is defined as mean – 3 times standard deviation. The tails of the distribution outside the range are treated as outliers and eliminated from the computation. The final volume weighted average rate together with standard deviation for the day is released at 10.45 a.m."
69,0,Microeconomics,"Definition: Microeconomics is the study of individuals, households and firms' behavior in decision making and allocation of resources. It generally applies to markets of goods and services and deals with individual and economic issues.Description: Microeconomic study deals with what choices people make, what factors influence their choices and how their decisions affect the goods markets by affecting the price, the supply and demand.Watch the video to learn more about Microeconomics"
70,0,Monetary Policy,"Definition: Monetary policy is the macroeconomic policy laid down by the central bank. It involves management of money supply and interest rate and is the demand side economic policy used by the government of a country to achieve macroeconomic objectives like inflation, consumption, growth and liquidity.Description: In India, monetary policy of the Reserve Bank of India is aimed at managing the quantity of money in order to meet the requirements of different sectors of the economy and to increase the pace of economic growth.	The RBI implements the monetary policy through open market operations, bank rate policy, reserve system, credit control policy, moral persuasion and through many other instruments. Using any of these instruments will lead to changes in the interest rate, or the money supply in the economy. Monetary policy can be expansionary and contractionary in nature. Increasing money supply and reducing interest rates indicate an expansionary policy. The reverse of this is a contractionary monetary policy.	For instance, liquidity is important for an economy to spur growth. To maintain liquidity, the RBI is dependent on the monetary policy. By purchasing bonds through open market operations, the RBI introduces money in the system and reduces the interest rate.What is Monetary Policy? Watch video..."
71,0,Money Supply,"Definition: The total stock of money circulating in an economy is the money supply. The circulating money involves the currency, printed notes, money in the deposit accounts and in the form of other liquid assets.Description: Valuation and analysis of the money supply help the economist and policy makers to frame the policy or to alter the existing policy of increasing or reducing the supply of money. The valuation is important as it ultimately affects the business cycle and thereby affects the economy.	Periodically, every country's central bank publishes the money supply data based on the monetary aggregates set by them. In India, the Reserve Bank of India follows M0, M1, M2, M3 and M4 monetary aggregates."
72,0,Monopoly,"Definition: A market structure characterized by a single seller, selling a unique product in the market. In a monopoly market, the seller faces no competition, as he is the sole seller of goods with no close substitute.Description: In a monopoly market, factors like government license, ownership of resources, copyright and patent and high starting cost make an entity a single seller of goods. All these factors restrict the entry of other sellers in the market. Monopolies also possess some information that is not known to other sellers.	Characteristics associated with a monopoly market make the single seller the market controller as well as the price maker. He enjoys the power of setting the price for his goods.Know more about Monopoly. View this..."
73,0,Moral Hazard,"Definition: Moral hazard is a situation in which one party gets involved in a risky event knowing that it is protected against the risk and the other party will incur the cost. It arises when both the parties have incomplete information about each other.Description: In a financial market, there is a risk that the borrower might engage in activities that are undesirable from the lender's point of view because they make him less likely to pay back a loan.	It occurs when the borrower knows that someone else will pay for the mistake he makes. This in turn gives him the incentive to act in a riskier way. This economic concept is known as moral hazard.Example: You have not insured your house from any future damages. It implies that a loss will be completely borne by you at the time of a mishappening like fire or burglary. Hence you will show extra care and attentiveness. You will install high tech burglar alarms and hire watchmen to avoid any unforeseen event.	But if your house is insured for its full value, then if anything happens you do not really lose anything. Therefore, you have less incentive to protect against any mishappening. In this case, the insurance firm bears the losses and the problem of moral hazard arises."
74,0,Mortgage-backed Securities,"Definition: Mortgage-backed security (MBS) is a type of asset-backed security collateralised by a pool of mortgages. This essentially represents transfer of credit risk from a primary lender, typically the originating bank, to an investment bank. The process involves purchase of mortgage loans by a bulge bracket investment bank from various loan originators and bundling them into pools.	By purchasing such mortgage loans, the investment bank buys the right to receive periodic cash payments that borrowers make. The buyer investment bank, in turn, creates a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and transfers the pool to it. The SPV issues securities to investors, who might be hedge funds, pension funds, or mutual funds.	Securities issued by the SPV to investors and backed by the principal and interest receivables of the mortgage borrowers are called mortgage-backed securities. Hence, MBS represents cash flows from a mortgage loan.Description: MBS is a type of asset-backed security (ABS) where the originating banks sell mortgage loans to a bulge bracket investment bank which in turn bundles and transfers the pool to an SPV created for the purpose of issuing MBS to investors.	The coupon payments to investors in an MBS are linked to the payments made by the mortgage borrowers. Unlike a typical bond, the coupon is a combination of both principal and interest payments. The face value of an MBS, therefore, decreases over time.	Various types of MBS exist in the market. The most common are:	1. Pass-through participation certificates: Under this, mortgage payments are transferred to the MBS investors on a pro rata basis. Most of the pass-through is backed by fixed rate mortgages, while adjustable rate mortgages (ARM) are also pooled for creation of MBS. Unlike a typical treasury bond, MBS does not pay fixed coupons to investors.	2. Collateralised mortgage obligations: In this case, MBS is categorised into pools of securities called tranches. The tranches are created commensurate with the riskiness of the mortgage in consideration. Each tranche has its own set of rules for distribution of principal and interest. This type of MBS is aimed at safeguarding investors from potential investment risks.	A typical risk in MBS is repayment. It is tantamount to Call risk in options. In the event of declining interest rates, mortgage borrowers tend to repay a higher share of their principal outstanding. This has both pros and cons. While it reduces the maturity risk, the risk of reinvestment rises owing to differential prepayment rates. This means the investor is confronted with the risk of reinvesting a larger share of his/her investment at a lower interest rate, which may not augur well for his/her portfolio.	On the contrary, when interest rates rise, mortgage borrowers tend to postpone their repayments. This increases the maturity of the MBS, and the holding period risk is enhanced. The rise in interest rates generally has a bearing on MBS prices in the secondary market as there exists an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices. 	3. Stripped mortgage-based security (SMBS): In this case, the MBS is segregated into interest-only SMBS and principal-only SMBS. In the case of interest SMBS, the coupon payment is linked to the interest received from the mortgage. On the contrary, in case of principal SMBS, the coupon payment is linked to the principal received from the mortgage.	4. Covered bonds: These bonds operate in the same manner as MBS. The difference lies in the treatment of assets in the books of the originating entity. While in case of MBS, the mortgage assets sold are removed from the books of the originating bank. In Covered Bonds the mortgage asset sold still remains in the books of the originating entity.	Mortgage-based securities are issued for a plethora of reasons, some of which are enumerated below: 	1. Replenishment of funds for originating banks as they sell mortgage loans to the investment bank	2. Transforming illiquid assets like mortgage into liquid and tradable assets, as MBS is backed by mortgage.	3. Allows investment banks to diversify the source of financing from traditional equity and debt. 	4. Allows originating banks to remove the mortgage assets from their books. This helps in improving their financial ratios.	For valuation of pass-throughs, weighted average maturity and weighted average coupon methods are used. These methods are employed for computing cash flows from the pass through MBS. In the real world, traders and money managers employ Bloomberg, CITI’s Yield book and Barclays’ POINT to analyse CDOs."
75,0,Mumbai Interbank Bid Rate (mibid),"Definition: MIBID or Mumbai Interbank Bid Rate is the rate of interest that a bank would be willing to pay to secure a deposit from another bank in the Indian interbank market. The MIBID rate is the weighted average of all interest rates that the participating banks offer on deposits on a particular day. It is calculated by the National Stock Exchange (NSE).Description: When banks offer loans to customers, they charge interest on them. Similarly, when a bank offers a short-time loan to another bank or to any other financial institution, it charges interest on that loan. This rate varies from bank to bank, depending on their policies. However, it is essentially benchmarked to the MIBID value.MIBID was initially launched for the overnight call money market. However, it was later extended to term money for 14 days/1 month/3 month durations on popular demand. MIBID is calculated using the weighted average of transactions obtained from the Clearing Corporation of India’s trading system. Only trades that happen between 9 am and 10 am in the negotiated dealing system -- call segment -- are considered. There should be a minimum of 10 trades with a combined value of Rs 500 crore for the calculation of the MIBID rate.The rate range is then calculated, varying from the weighted average rate + 3* standard deviation and weighted average rate - 3* standard deviation. Trades executed at rates outside the maximum and minimum values will be considered as outliers and shall be excluded from the computation process.In case either of the criteria mentioned above is not met, the cut-off time for the inclusion of trades will be extended by 30 minutes. In case the criteria of 10 trades with value of Rs 500 crore are not met during the cut-off time, another 30-minute window is allowed for picking trades. If even then the criteria are not satisfied, the previous day’s values are referred to for MIBID calculation. This practice of using previous day’s values can continue only for two consecutive days, failing which CCIL does not disseminate any rate."
76,0,Net Interest Income (nii),"Definition: Net interest income (NII) is the difference between the interest income a bank earns from its lending activities and the interest it pays to depositors.	Net interest income = Interest earned - interest paid	Assuming ABC Bank earned an interest income of Rs 15,000 crore on its assets comprising all kinds of loans, mortgages and securities for the year ended March 31, 2015 and paid Rs 13,750 crore in interest to depositors, the net interest income would be: Net interest income = Rs 15,000 crore - Rs 13,750 crore = Rs 1,250 croreDescription: Net interest income can differ from bank to bank due to variations in the composition and quality of assets and interest-bearing funds, change in yields of interest-earning assets and in interest rates paid on liabilities. NIIs of lenders with assets and liabilities bearing variable rates are more vulnerable to change in interest rates. If the spread between rate-sensitive assets (RSAs) and rate-sensitive liabilities (RSLs) increases, a rise in interest rate can make interest income rise more than interest expenses. In such a case, NII also goes up. On the other hand, when the spread between RSAs and RSLs falls, a rise in interest rate can make interest expenses rise more than interest income, leading to a drop in NII. NII, meanwhile, can also get impacted by any rise or fall in non-performing assets (NPAs). According to the Reserve Bank of India's June edition of financial stability report, NII growth of scheduled commercial banks has been falling over the past couple of years. It stood at 9.3 per cent for FY15 compared with 11.7 per cent for FY14 and 34.6 per cent for FY11."
77,0,Net National Income,"Definition:  Net National Income is Gross National Income or Gross National Product less depreciation.  Description: Gross National Product (GNP) is Gross Domestic Product (GDP) plus net factor income from abroad. It measures the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced by the country’s factors of production irrespective of their location. 	Only the finished or final goods are considered as factoring intermediate goods used for manufacturing would amount to double counting. It includes taxes but does not include subsidies. When depreciation is deducted from the GNP, we get Net National Income.Also See: Gross Domestic Saving, Currency Deposit Ratio "
78,0,Nim,"Definition: Net interest margin or NIM denotes the difference between the interest income earned and the interest paid by a bank or financial institution relative to its interest-earning assets like cash. Thanks to its frequent usage, it’s become a part of the banking and financial lexicon.Description: Net interest margin = (Investment returns – interest expenses) / average earning on assets	NIM measures the effectiveness of a company’s investment decisions, particularly for financial institutions. For example, if a bank had earned an interest income of Rs 8,000 crore and paid Rs 6,000 crore on its deposits on an average loan asset of Rs 64,000 crore, the NIM for the year will be 0.03125 or 3.215 per cent. [(8,000 - 6,000)/ 64,000 = 0.03125 or 3.125%].	For a bank, if the non-performing assets (NPAs) are rising, the interest earned would fall and the NIM will decline. In case the demand for savings increases relative to the demand for loans, the NIM will fall. Meanwhile, a higher NIM would increase the profitability of the lender. A negative NIM indicates that the lender has been unable to make good use of its assets, as returns produced by investments has failed to offset interest expenses. Thus, NIM is a significant indicator of financial stability of a lender. Big lenders in India, such as the SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Punjab National Bank, reported NIMs ranging between 3 per cent and 4.5 per cent for FY15. NIM has some limitations as well. The performance metric cannot be confused with profitability, as it does not account for fees and non-interest incomes that banks generate through services related to brokerage and deposit accounts. In addition, NIM of two banks can’t be compared as their activities may differ due to asset sizes, composition of customer base, priority sector lending and other factors."
79,0,Non Performing Assets,"Definition: A non performing asset (NPA) is a loan or advance for which the principal or interest payment remained overdue for a period of 90 days.Description: Banks are required to classify NPAs further into Substandard, Doubtful and Loss assets.1. Substandard assets: Assets which has remained NPA for a period less than or equal to 12 months.2. Doubtful assets: An asset would be classified as doubtful if it has remained in the substandard category for a period of 12 months.3. Loss assets: As per RBI, “Loss asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted, although there may be some salvage or recovery value.”Also See: Foreign Exchange Reserves, Balance of Payment, Base RateWatch the video here:"
80,0,Paradox,"Definition: Paradox in economics is the situation where the variables fail to follow the generally laid principles and assumptions of the theory and behave in an opposite fashion.Description: Paradoxes are very common in economics. A few of them are Giffen's Paradox, Leontief's Paradox and Paradox of Thrift.For example: The demand curve of any commodity is generally downward sloping, but Giffen's Paradox suggests that under certain situations Giffen goods have an upward sloping demand curve."
81,0,Paradox Of Thrift,"Definition: Paradox of thrift was popularized by the renowned economist John Maynard Keynes.	It states that individuals try to save more during an economic recession, which essentially leads to a fall in aggregate demand and hence in economic growth. Such a situation is harmful for everybody as investments give lower returns than normal.Description: Keynes further said that such a mass increase in savings eventually hurts the economy as a whole.	This theory was heavily criticized by non-Keynesian economists on the ground that an increase in savings allows banks to lend more. This will make interest rates go down and lead to an increase in lending and, therefore, spending."
82,0,Payments Banks,"Definition: A payments bank is like any other bank, but operating on a smaller scale without involving any credit risk. In simple words, it can carry out most banking operations but can’t advance loans or issue credit cards. It can accept demand deposits (up to Rs 1 lakh), offer remittance services, mobile payments/transfers/purchases and other banking services like ATM/debit cards, net banking and third party fund transfers.Description: In September 2013, the Reserve Bank of India constituted a committee headed by Dr Nachiket Mor to study 'Comprehensive financial services for small businesses and low income households'. The objective of the committee was to propose measures for achieving financial inclusion and increased access to financial services.	The committee submitted its report to RBI in January 2014. One of the key suggestions of the committee was to introduce specialised banks or ‘payments bank’ to cater to the lower income groups and small businesses so that by January 1, 2016 each Indian resident can have a global bank account.	Why payments banks? The main objective of payments bank is to widen the spread of payment and financial services to small business, low-income households, migrant labour workforce in secured technology-driven environment.	With payments banks, RBI seeks to increase the penetration level of financial services to the remote areas of the country.	Existing prepaid payment instruments (PPI model) like Airtel Money does not give pay any interest on deposits. "
83,0,Percentage Point,"Definition: The difference between two percentages is termed as percentage point. Percentage point is used to show the changes in an indicator with respect to its previous standings.Description: Percentage point is used extensively in macro-economic indicators like inflation. One percentage point is also equal to 100 basis points. For example, inflation in India in November 2012 was 7.24% and inflation in December 2012 was 7.18%. Thus, we can say that there was a change of 0.06 percentage points in inflation."
84,0,Perfect Competition,"Definition: Perfect competition describes a market structure where competition is at its greatest possible level. To make it more clear, a market which exhibits the following characteristics in its structure is said to show perfect competition:	1. Large number of buyers and sellers	2. Homogenous product is produced by every firm	3. Free entry and exit of firms	4. Zero advertising cost	5. Consumers have perfect knowledge about the market and are well aware of any changes in the market. Consumers indulge in rational decision making.	6. All the factors of production, viz. labour, capital, etc, have perfect mobility in the market and are not hindered by any market factors or market forces.	7. No government intervention	8. No transportation costs	9. Each firm earns normal profits and no firms can earn super-normal profits.	10. Every firm is a price taker. It takes the price as decided by the forces of demand and supply. No firm can influence the price of the product.Description: Ideally, perfect competition is a hypothetical situation which cannot possibly exist in a market. However, perfect competition is used as a base to compare with other forms of market structure. No industry exhibits perfect competition in India."
85,0,Phillips Curve,"Definition: The inverse relationship between unemployment rate and inflation when graphically charted is called the Phillips curve. William Phillips pioneered the concept first in his paper ""The Relation between Unemployment and the Rate of Change of Money Wage Rates in the United Kingdom, 1861-1957,' in 1958. This theory is now proven for all major economies of the world.Description: The theory states that the higher the rate of inflation, the lower the unemployment and vice-versa. Thus, high levels of employment can be achieved only at high levels of inflation. The policies to induce growth in an economy, increase in employment and sustained development are heavily dependent on the findings of the Phillips curve.	However, the implications of Phillips curve have been found to be true only in the short term. Phillips curve fails to justify the situations of stagflation, when both inflation and unemployment are alarmingly high."
86,0,Ponzi Scheme,"Definition: A ponzi scheme is an investment plan in which the operator or the operating company pays returns to investors from the new capital coming in from new investors instead off the profits of the business. The investors get attracted to these schemes because of the unusually high rate of return offered within shorter time spans compared to other conventional investment options.Description: These schemes start off as legitimate businesses. However, they often fail to sustain them with operating income alone. So, in order to meet the promises made to their investors, the capital gathered from new members gets used up. For example, a hedge fund can turn into a ponzi scheme if it faces unexpected losses and cannot legitimately meet the desired returns. The promoters then start forging reports instead of admitting their failures.	To gain confidence of investors, the promoters usually give decent payouts in the first few months, luring investors to put in more money. This sets off a ripple effect, bringing in new investors to participate. The initial ones then get paid out from the funds received from new investors.	In many cases, investors seeing returns choose to remain invested and not take any cash withdrawals. The promoter is also more than happy, just showing them balances of what they have earned, thus maintaining the deception that the scheme is giving promised returns. To further gain confidence, the scheme even allows the first investors to make full withdrawals.	Such schemes can unravel due to any of the below mentioned reasons:	1. The promoter vanishes with the entire investment fund without giving payouts to investors	2. New investments stop flowing in, creating a liquidity crunch. This causes a panic situation as more people start demanding returns.	3. Market forces prompt mass withdrawal of funds creating an issue for the promoter."
87,0,Poverty Trap,"Definition: Poverty trap is a spiraling mechanism which forces people to remain poor. It is so binding in itself that it doesn't allow the poor people to escape it. Poverty trap generally happens in developing and under-developing countries, and is caused by a lack of capital and credit to people.Description: Poverty trap can be broken by planned investments in the economy and providing people the means to earn and be employed. A series of poverty alleviation programs can be enforced to raise individuals out of poverty by providing monetary aid for a period of time.	But if the plan fails, people will become dependent on such programs forever and may even go deeper down in the poverty spiral. However, poorer countries find this to be difficult, leading to the over-exploitation of natural resources and land."
88,0,Preferences,"Definition: Preferences refer to certain characteristics any consumer wants to have in a good or service to make it preferable to him. This could be the level of happiness, degree of satisfaction, utility from the product, etc.Description: Preferences are the main factors that influence consumer demand. Economists study preferences to perceive the demand for each commodity and the future implications it may cause."
89,0,Price Ceiling,"Definition: Price ceiling is a situation when the price charged is more than or less than the equilibrium price determined by market forces of demand and supply. It has been found that higher price ceilings are ineffective. Price ceiling has been found to be of great importance in the house rent market.Description: Government imposes a price ceiling to control the maximum prices that can be charged by suppliers for the commodity. This is done to make commodities affordable to the general public. However, prolonged application of a price ceiling can lead to black marketing and unrest in the supply side.	For example: Let's consider the house-rent market. Here in the given graph, a price of Rs. 3 has been determined as the equilibrium price with the quantity at 30 homes. Now, the government determines a price ceiling of Rs. 2. At this rate there is a shortage (demand for 40 houses, but supply is for only 20 houses). In the long run, the extra 20 people will try to get a house on rent, which will eventually give rise to black market and higher rents."
90,0,Price Floor,"Definition: Price floor is a situation when the price charged is more than or less than the equilibrium price determined by market forces of demand and supply. By observation, it has been found that lower price floors are ineffective. Price floor has been found to be of great importance in the labour-wage market.Description: Minimum wage laws have been passed in various countries to determine the minimum wages to be paid to the worker. Minimum wages are formulated from the demand-supply curve of labour. This helps the government ensure higher wages and a good standard of living for the workers. But this has a flip side too. Price floor leads to a lesser number of workers than in case of equilibrium wage. This is shown by the diagram below.	Equilibrium wage rate is Rs. 3. The price floor is determined at Rs.4, which is good for workers, who will earn more than before. But the flip side is that while at equilibrium there were 30 workers, after the price floor there are only 20 workers. Thus 10 workers have been laid off. At a wage of Rs. 4 we see a gap of 20 workers (40 workers are willing to work but only 20 workers get work), thus giving rise to a surplus of workers."
91,0,Price Mechanism,"Definition: Price mechanism refers to the system where the forces of demand and supply determine the prices of commodities and the changes therein. It is the buyers and sellers who actually determine the price of a commodity.Definition: Price mechanism is the outcome of the free play of market forces of demand and supply. However, sometimes the government controls the price mechanism to make commodities affordable for the poor people too.For example, the Government of India recently passed an order to decontrol the prices of diesel and remove it from the jurisdiction of the government. Now the prices will be determined by the demand from consumers and supply from the oil companies."
92,0,Principle Agent Problem,"Definition: The principle agent problem arises when one party (agent) agrees to work in favor of another party (principle) in return for some incentives. Such an agreement may incur huge costs for the agent, thereby leading to the problems of moral hazard and conflict of interest. Owing to the costs incurred, the agent might begin to pursue his own agenda and ignore the best interest of the principle, thereby causing the principal agent problem to occur.Description: The costs to agent and subsequent conflict of interest arise due to the skewed information symmetry and the risk of failure faced by the principal.For example: Shareholders of a company appoint managers to look after the proceedings of the company and earn profits on their behalf. The shareholders expect the managers to distribute all the profits to the shareholders. But the managers sensing their own growth and salary expectation try to retain the profits for future as a safe side. This can lead to principle agent problem. It is one of the most noticed problems in the current situation when most companies are not being managed by the owners themselves."
93,0,Privatization,"Definition: The transfer of ownership, property or business from the government to the private sector is termed privatization. The government ceases to be the owner of the entity or business.	The process in which a publicly-traded company is taken over by a few people is also called privatization. The stock of the company is no longer traded in the stock market and the general public is barred from holding stake in such a company. The company gives up the name 'limited' and starts using 'private limited' in its last name.Description: Privatization is considered to bring more efficiency and objectivity to the company, something that a government company is not concerned about. India went for privatization in the historic reforms budget of 1991, also known as 'New Economic Policy or LPG policy'.Watch the video here:"
94,0,Producer Surplus,"	(##include msid=4006719,type=11 ##)Definition: Producer surplus is defined as the difference between the amount the producer is willing to supply goods for and the actual amount received by him when he makes the trade. Producer surplus is a measure of producer welfare. It is shown graphically as the area above the supply curve and below the equilibrium price.	Here the producer surplus is shown in gray. As the price increases, the incentive for producing more goods increases, thereby increasing the producer surplus.Description: A producer always tries to increase his producer surplus by trying to sell more and more at higher prices. However, it is simply not possible to increase the producer surplus indefinitely since at higher prices there might be very little or no demand for goods."
95,0,Production Gap,"Definition: The difference between actual production and estimated production in industry is known as production gap. It is generally calculated as the percentage deviation from estimated production. The production gap is a major economic indicator in GDP analysis.Description: Production gap in GDP, coupled with data on unemployment and inflation, can explain the reasons for the major problems in any economy. An industry, or a country, can thus formulate strategies to reduce the gap and try to achieve the estimated production."
96,0,Production Possibility Frontier,"Definition: Production possibility frontier is the graph which indicates the various production possibilities of two commodities when resources are fixed. The production of one commodity can only be increased by sacrificing the production of the other commodity. It is also called the production possibility curve or product transformation curve.Description: The state of technology is taken to be constant. Since the production of one commodity can be increased only by decreasing the production of the other commodity, production possibility curve also measures the production efficiency of the commodities. The production possibility frontier helps in deciding the commodities most beneficial to society, but this response is limited in itself as there is a choice between two commodities only."
97,0,Profitability Index,"Definition: Profitability index is a financial tool which tells us whether an investment should be accepted or rejected. It uses the time value concept of money and is calculated by the following formula.The accept-reject decision is made as follows:	If PI is greater than 1, accept the investment. If PI is less than 1, reject the investment and if PI = 1, then indifferent (may accept or reject the decision)Description: Profitability index helps in ranking investments and deciding the best investment that should be made. PI greater than one indicates that present value of future cash inflows from the investment is more than the initial investment, thereby indicating that it will earn profits.	PI of less than one indicates loss from the investment. PI equal to one means that there are no profits. Thus, profitability index helps investors in making decisions about whether or not to make a particular investment."
98,0,Progressive Tax,"Definition: Progressive tax is the taxing mechanism in which the taxing authority charges more taxes as the income of the taxpayer increases. A higher tax is collected from the taxpayers who earn more and lower taxes from taxpayers earning less. The government uses a progressive tax mechanism.Description: Under progressive taxes, it is believed that people who earn more should pay more. The income tax is divided into slabs. As the income of the tax payer crosses a benchmark income, a new rate of tax (higher than before) is charged to him."
99,0,Property Tax,"Definition: Property tax is the annual amount paid by a land owner to the local government or the municipal corporation of his area. The property includes all tangible real estate property, his house, office building and the property he has rented to others.Description: In India, the municipal corporation of a particular area assesses and imposes the property tax annually or semi annually. The tax amount is based on the area, construction, property size, building etc. The collected amount is mainly used for public services like repairing roads, construction schools, buildings, sanitation	Central government properties and vacant property are generally exempt. Property tax comprises taxes like lighting tax, water tax and drainage tax."
100,0,Proportional Tax,"Definition: Proportional tax is the taxing mechanism in which the taxing authority charges the same rate of tax from each taxpayer, irrespective of income. This means that lower class, or middle class, or upper class people pay the same amount of tax. Since the tax is charged at a flat rate for everyone, whether earning higher income or lower income, it is also called flat tax.Description: Proportional tax is based on the theory that since everybody is equal, taxes should also be charged the same way.	It is unfair to charge more from anybody having a higher income. The government charges a flat rate of 30% on the income earned by the companies in India, exclusive of surcharge and educational cess. A surcharge of 10% and a cess of (2%+ SHEC 1%) are collected on the tax amount collected."
101,0,Public Distribution System,"Definition: Public distribution system is a government-sponsored chain of shops entrusted with the work of distributing basic food and non-food commodities to the needy sections of the society at very cheap prices.	Wheat, rice, kerosene, sugar, etc. are a few major commodities distributed by the public distribution system.Description: Food Corporation of India, a government entity, manages the public distribution system.	The system is often blamed for its inefficiency and rural-urban bias. It has not been able to fulfill the objective for which it was formed. Moreover, it has frequently been criticized for instances of corruption and black marketing."
102,0,Purchasing Power Parity,"Definition: The theory aims to determine the adjustments needed to be made in the exchange rates of two currencies to make them at par with the purchasing power of each other. In other words, the expenditure on a similar commodity must be same in both currencies when accounted for exchange rate. The purchasing power of each currency is determined in the process.Description: Purchasing power parity is used worldwide to compare the income levels in different countries. PPP thus makes it easy to understand and interpret the data of each country.Example: Let's say that a pair of shoes costs Rs 2500 in India. Then it should cost $50 in America when the exchange rate is 50 between the dollar and the rupee.Watch the video here to learn more about Purchasing power parity"
103,0,Quantitative Easing,"Definition: Quantitative easing is an occasionally used monetary policy, which is adopted by the government to increase money supply in the economy in order to further increase lending by commercial banks and spending by consumers. The central bank (Read: The Reserve Bank of India) infuses a pre-determined quantity of money into the economy by buying financial assets from commercial banks and private entities. This leads to an increase in banks' reserves.Description: Quantitative easing is aimed at maintaining price levels, or inflation. However, these policies can backfire heavily, leading to very high levels of inflation. In case commercial banks fail to lend excess reserves, it may lead to an unbalance in the money market."
104,0,Quantity Demanded,"Definition: Quantity demanded is the quantity of a commodity that people are willing to buy at a particular price at a particular point of time.Description: Different quantities can be demanded at different prices at a particular point of time. When all the prices, along with quantity demanded, are drawn on a graph, the demand curve is formed. Quantity demanded can change at the same price depending upon factors like recession, changes in the taste of the consumer, etc."
105,0,Quantity Supplied,"Definition: Quantity supplied is the quantity of a commodity that producers are willing to sell at a particular price at a particular point of time.Description: Different quantities can be supplied at different prices at a particular point of time. When all the prices along with quantity supplied are drawn on a graph, the supply curve is formed. Quantity supplied can change at the same price depending upon factors like recession, changes in the prices of the raw materials, etc."
106,0,Quantity Theory Of Money,"Definition: Quantity theory of money states that money supply and price level in an economy are in direct proportion to one another. When there is a change in the supply of money, there is a proportional change in the price level and vice-versa.It is supported and calculated by using the Fisher Equation on Quantity Theory of Money.M*V= P*T	where,M = Money supplyV = Velocity of moneyP = Price levelT = volume of the transactionsDescription: The theory is accepted by most economists per se. However, Keynesian economists and economists from the Monetarist School of Economics have criticized the theory.	According to them, the theory fails in the short run when the prices are sticky. Moreover, it has been proved that velocity of money doesn't remain constant over time. Despite all this, the theory is very well respected and is heavily used to control inflation in the market."
107,0,Rational Behaviour,"Definition: This is a part of decision making practice wherein an individual/company exercises sensible choice making, which provides him with the optimum amount of benefit.Description: Rational behaviour facilitates decision making that may not always give the best possible returns materially. It strives to achieve benefits that are most optimal in nature to the decision maker, be it monetary or non-monetary.	Economists, while developing any theory of economics, make the fundamental assumption that entities, which are part of the theory, exercise rational behaviour while making decisions. For example, if a person chooses a job with a profile of his liking instead of a high paying job, then it would be also termed as rational behaviour."
108,0,Rationing,"Definition: Rationing refers to an artificial control on the distribution of scarce resources, food items, industrial production, etc. In banking, credit rationing is a situation when banks limit the supply of loans to consumers. In economics, rationing refers to an artificial control of the supply and demand of commodities.Description: Rationing is done to ensure the proper distribution of resources without any unwanted waste. Banks use credit rationing to control lending beyond the monetary base of the bank. Controlling the prices and demand and supply leads to availability of goods and services for every section of the society."
109,0,Real Business Cycle Theory,"Definition: An economy witnesses a number of business cycles in its life. These business cycles involve phases of high or even low level of economic activities. A business cycle involves periods of economic expansion, recession, trough and recovery. The duration of such stages may vary from case to case.	The real business cycle theory makes the fundamental assumption that an economy witnesses all these phases of business cycle due to technology shocks. Technological shocks include innovations, bad weather, stricter safety regulations, etc.Description: According to the theory, monetary shocks or expectation changes have no role to play in a business cycle."
110,0,Real Economic Growth Rate,"Definition: Real Economic Growth Rate is the rate at which a nation's Gross Domestic product (GDP) changes/grows from one year to another. GDP is the market value of all the goods and services produced in a country in a particular time period.Description: Real Economic Growth Rate takes into account the effects of inflation. Since inflation plays a key role in the GDP of an economy, it is very important to ascertain the effects of inflation on GDP. As a result, the Real Economic Growth Rate takes into account the buying power and is inflation-adjusted. This is the reason it is considered to be a better measure of growth rate than the nominal growth rate."
111,0,Real Gdp At Factor Cost,"Definition: Real GDP is the nominal GDP after adjusting for any price changes attributable to either inflation or deflation.   Description: Nominal GDP or the GDP at current price can present a distorted picture of the actual growth in GDP owing to price changes. However, if we consider the price of base year as constant and compute the GDP growth rate of the current year using that constant price, the value so arrived at will give a true picture of the actual growth rate in GDP. This measure is called the Real GDP or the GDP at constant price. It does not factor taxes and subsidies.  	A new indicator called GDP deflator is derived by dividing nominal GDP by real GDP. It is a measure of price changes in the economy.       Also See: Gross National Product, Gross Domestic Saving "
112,0,Recession,"Definition: Recession is a slowdown or a massive contraction in economic activities. A significant fall in spending generally leads to a recession.Description: Such a slowdown in economic activities may last for some quarters thereby completely hampering the growth of an economy. In such a situation, economic indicators such as GDP, corporate profits, employments, etc., fall.	This creates a mess in the entire economy. To tackle the menace, economies generally react by loosening their monetary policies by infusing more money into the system, i.e., by increasing the money supply.	This is done by reducing the interest rates. Increased spending by the government and decreased taxation are also considered good answers for this problem. The recession which hit the globe in 2008 is the most recent example of a recession."
113,0,Recessionary Gap,"Definition: This is a situation wherein the real GDP is lower than the potential GDP at the full employment level. The economy operates below the full employment level in a recessionary gap.Description: Recessionary gap is also termed as contractionary gap. An economy doesn't necessarily operate at the full employment level. So the difference that exists between the potential full employment equilibrium and the actual ones is the recessionary gap.	This recessionary gap pushes prices down in the long term. Recession refers to a general slowdown in economic activities, i.e. a business cycle contraction.	Generally, a recessionary gap occurs when an economy is approaching recession. So it is also associated with business cycle contraction."
114,0,Regressive Tax,"Definition: Under this system of taxation, the tax rate diminishes as the taxable amount increases. In other words, there is an inverse relationship between the tax rate and taxable income. The rate of taxation decreases as the income of taxpayers increases.Description: This system of taxation generally benefits the higher sections of the society having higher incomes as they need to pay tax at lesser rates. On the other hand, people with lesser incomes are burdened with higher rate of taxation.Example: A person earning Rs 1,00,000 p.a. might be required to pay taxes at 15% whereas a person earning Rs 5,00,000 p.a. might be required to pay taxes at 10%."
115,0,Regulatory Risk,"Definition: Regulatory risk is the risk of a change in regulations and law that might affect an industry or a business. Such changes in regulations can make significant changes in the framework of an industry, changes in cost-structure, etc.Description: Every policy, especially the budget, is very closely watched due to this reason. For example: A policy change in the excise duty on rubber from 20% to 30% will lead to an increase in the cost of rubber. Hence, prices will increase in the market."
116,0,Rent Seeking,"Definition: When a firm uses its resources to procure an unwarranted monetary gain from external elements, be it directly or indirectly, without giving anything in return to them or the society, it is termed as rent-seeking.Description: Instead of creating wealth, a firm seeks to obtain financial gains from others through alteration/ manipulation of the environment where economic activities take place. A popular example for rent-seeking is political lobbying by companies. These are primarily done by companies in order to make economic gains through government action.	This might be done by a company to get subsidy from the government for the product which it produces or increasing tariff rates by the government for its services, etc. Such a practice neither leads to creation of new wealth, nor does it benefit the society."
117,0,Repo Rate,"Definition: Repo rate is the rate at which the central bank of a country (Reserve Bank of India in case of India) lends money to commercial banks in the event of any shortfall of funds. Repo rate is used by monetary authorities to control inflation.Description: In the event of inflation, central banks increase repo rate as this acts as a disincentive for banks to borrow from the central bank. This ultimately reduces the money supply in the economy and thus helps in arresting inflation.The central bank takes the contrary position in the event of a fall in inflationary pressures. Repo and reverse repo rates form a part of the liquidity adjustment facility.All that you need to know about Repo Rate. Watch video.... What is repo rate and reverse repo rate?Repo Rate: It is the interest rate at which the central bank of a country lends money to commercial banks. The centra...  Read MoreRepo Rate: It is the interest rate at which the central bank of a country lends money to commercial banks. The central bank in India i.e. the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) uses repo rate to regulate liquidity in the economy. In banking, repo rate is related to ‘repurchase option’ or ‘repurchase agreement’.When there is a shortage of funds, commercial banks borrow money from the central bank which is repaid according to the repo rate applicable. The central bank provides these short terms loans against securities such as treasury bills or government bonds. This monetary policy is used by the central bank to control inflation or increase the liquidity of banks. The government increases the repo rate when they need to control prices and restrict borrowings. On the other hand, the repo rate is decreased when there is a need to infuse more money into the market and support economic growth.An increase in repo rate means commercial banks have to pay more interest for the money lent to them and therefore, a change in repo rate eventually affects public borrowings such as home loan, EMIs, etc. From interest charged by commercial banks on loans to the returns from deposits, various financial and investment instruments are indirectly dependent on the repo rate.     Reverse Repo Rate: This is the rate the central bank of a country pays its commercial banks to park their excess funds in the central bank. Reverse repo rate is also a monetary policy used by the central bank (which is RBI in India) to regulate the flow of money in the market.When in need, the central bank of a country borrows money from commercial banks and pays them interest as per the reverse repo rate applicable. At a given point in time, the reverse repo rate provided by RBI is generally lower than the repo rate. While repo rate is used to regulate liquidity in the economy, reverse repo rate is used to control cash flow in the market. When there is inflation in the economy, RBI increases the reverse repo rate to encourage commercial banks to make deposits in the central bank and earn returns. This in turn absorbs excessive funds from the market and reduces the money available for the public to borrow. Read LessWhat is the current repo?Repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the central bank of a country (which in the case of...  Read MoreRepo rate is the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the central bank of a country (which in the case of India is the Reserve Bank of India or RBI) when they are in the need of funds. On the other hand, reverse repo rate is the interest rate paid to commercial banks when they deposit their excess funds in the central bank or when the central bank borrows money from them. As of April 2021, RBI’s repo rate stands at 4% and reverse repo rate at 3.35%. The repo rate was reduced by 40 basis points from 4.4% to 4% and the reverse repo rate was pegged at 3.35% in May 2020. RBI has kept these crucial rates unchanged since the last five sessions to accommodate the current economic situation.RBI keeps revising the repo rate and reverse repo rate periodically according to the state of the economy. Every sector of the economy is affected by changes made to these interest rates. Most banks have an RRLR or repo rate linked lending rate and when the repo rate is revised, banks are directed by RBI to change the interest rate applicable on various loans accordingly. Generally, when the repo rate is reduced, the interest rate charged on home loans, EMIs etc. also reduces, making it easier for customers to avail loans or borrow from banks. This in turn helps in the economic growth of the country. Though changes made to repo rates are meant to affect the interest rate of commercial banks, the actual rates applicable for the customer may vary from bank to bank and is also dependent on various factors including the terms of the loan such as the amount being borrowed, tenure of repayment, etc.    Read LessWhat are SLR and CRR?SLR: Statutory liquidity ratio or SLR refers to the minimum percentage of deposits that needs to be maintained by com...  Read MoreSLR: Statutory liquidity ratio or SLR refers to the minimum percentage of deposits that needs to be maintained by commercial banks in the form of liquid assets, cash, gold, government securities, etc. SLR is essentially a portion of the bank’s Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) or total demand deposits and time-based deposits. The limit of SLR for commercial banks is decided by the central bank of the country (Reserve Bank of India or RBI in India) but the deposits are maintained by the respective banks themselves. However, the SLR cannot be used by the bank for lending. The deposits designated towards SLR are eligible for earning interests. This monetary policy of the RBI is aimed at ensuring the solvency of the banks or ensuring that the banks, at any point in time, are capable of paying back their liabilities. This in turn ascertains that the depositor’s money is safe and helps in increasing their confidence in the bank.  SLR is used to regulate inflation and maintain cash flow in the economy. When there is inflation, RBI increases the SLR to restrict the lending capacity of the bank. And when there is a need to infuse cash into the system, RBI reduces the SLR to help banks offer loans at better rates and improve borrowings.CRR: Cash reserve ratio or CRR is a portion of a commercial bank’s total deposits that needs to be maintained at the central bank of the country (which is RBI in India). Just like SLR, the limit of CRR to be maintained is also determined by RBI. However, here the deposit is in the form of liquid cash and has to be kept in an account with the RBI.Banks are not allowed to utilise the CRR deposited for giving out loans or for other lending purposes. Apart from that, CRR deposits are also not eligible for earning interests. CRR helps in ensuring that the bank always has enough cash to disburse when depositors need it.The purpose of this monetary policy is to check inflation in the economy. When CRR is increased, the cash reserves of commercial banks are depleted which limits their lending capacity. This reduces borrowings and helps in controlling inflation.

Read MoreRepo stands for ‘repurchase option’ or ‘repurchase agreement’. It is a form of short term borrowing that allows banks or financial institutions to borrow money from other banks or financial institutions against government securities with an agreement to buy those securities back after a specified time period and at a predetermined price (which is higher than the initial sell price).A repurchase agreement is a secured way of raising short-term capital for banks. The duration of these loans generally varies between one day to a fortnight. In this system, the borrower enters into a repo or repurchase agreement, whereas, for the lender, it’s a reverse repurchase agreement or reverse repo.In India, the Reserve Bank of India or RBI (which is the central bank in the country) lends money to commercial banks with an interest rate which is called repo rate. These loans are sanctioned in exchange for securities to help the banks achieve their financial goals. On the other hand, RBI also has provisions for banks to park their excessive funds for which RBI pays interest, which is determined by reverse repo rate. This interest rate is also applicable when RBI borrows money from commercial banks.   RBI uses repo and reverse repo to maintain economic stability in the country. When there is a need for an economic boost, RBI pumps funds into the system by helping commercial banks borrow money from the bank. Using repo, banks raise the necessary capital to increase their lending capacity. This ensures liquidity for the bank and proper cash flow into the market. But, in the case of inflation, RBI uses reverse repo to absorb funds from the market to regulate the lending capabilities of commercial banks.

Read MoreRepo rate is the rate of interest at which commercial banks in India borrow money from the Reserve Bank of India. Commercial banks are required to deposit securities such as government bonds or treasury bills as collateral to avail these loans from the central bank of the country. These are generally short term loans that banks take when there is a shortage of cash.Just like the repo rate, RBI also has a reverse repo rate which is the rate that the RBI pays to the commercial banks when they deposit their excess funds in the central bank. Reverse repo rate is generally lower than the repo rate.In a bi-monthly monetary meet held on April 7, 2021, RBI announced that the current repo rate has been kept at 4% and the reverse repo rate at 3.35%. This is the fifth time in a row that these crucial rates haven’t been revised. In May 2020, the repo rate was reduced by 40 basis points from 4.4% to 4% and the reverse repo rate was made 3.35%.Repo rate and reverse repo rate are monetary policies used by RBI to maintain economic stability in the country. Suppose the country is going through a cash crunch. In this case, RBI will reduce the repo rate to help banks borrow more and make loans available to the public at reduced rates. Now, if the country’s economy is experiencing inflation, RBI will increase the reverse repo rate to limit borrowings by commercial banks. This, in turn, will reduce their lending capacity and keep inflation in check.   Read LessWhat is MSF rate?MSF or marginal standing facility is a system of the Reserve Bank of India that allows scheduled commercial banks to ...  Read MoreMSF or marginal standing facility is a system of the Reserve Bank of India that allows scheduled commercial banks to avail funds overnight. The interest rate charged by RBI on such borrowings is called the MSF rate or marginal standing facility rate. RBI has introduced this provision to help scheduled banks when inter-bank liquidity completely dries up and they are in urgent need of money. MSF is sanctioned against government securities and the MSF rate is around 100 basis points or one percent higher than the repo rate. These loans fall under RBI’s liquidity adjustment facility or LAF. The maximum amount that can be availed under MSF is a percentage of the bank’s NDTL or net demand and time liabilities. Banks can use their SLR or statutory liquidity ratio to take loans under MSF. This is a short-term loan used to maintain the liquidity of banks.  MSF helps in reducing the volatility of overnight lending rates and helps banks manage situations where there is a short-term asset liability mismatch. RBI uses this monetary policy to regulate the supply of funds into scheduled banks and also ensures safety for the depositors. Though limited, but the MSF rate at which banks borrow money from RBI can also affect retail loans. Generally, loans rates available for the public tend to get cheaper when MSF rate decreases and vice versa. Moreover, RBI also revises the MSF rate to strengthen the value of rupee, when required. Monetary standing facility was introduced by the RBI as a provision for banks to avail overnight funds during a revision of the country’s monetary policy in 2011-12.  Read Less"
118,0,Reserve Ratio,"Definition: Also known as Cash Reserve Ratio, it is the percentage of deposits which commercial banks are required to keep as cash according to the directions of the central bank.Description: The reserve ratio is an important tool of the monetary policy of an economy and plays an essential role in regulating the money supply. When the central bank wants to increase money supply in the economy, it lowers the reserve ratio. As a result, commercial banks have higher funds to disburse as loans, thereby increasing the money supply in an economy.	On the other hand, for controlling inflation, the CRR is generally increased, thereby decreasing the lending power of banks, which in turn reduces the money supply in an economy."
119,0,Residual Claimant,"Definition: According to the residual claimant theory, after all factors of production/service have received their remuneration, the person/agent supposed to receive the left/residual amount is known as the residual claimant.Description: The residual claimant receives the remainder of the sum after all costs have been accounted for. The residual claimant need not be the same person all the time.	For example, a firm might be having several factors engaged directly or indirectly in production, such as labourers, suppliers, bondholders, shareholders, etc. The firm owes definite amounts to factors like labourers, suppliers, etc. in order to compensate them for the services provided. After making payment to all other parties, the shareholders might be receiving payment in the end, i.e., they might be receiving the residual amount. Therefore, in this case, the shareholders will be considered as the residual claimants."
120,0,Revealed Preferences,"Definition: This is a theory of economics laid down by Paul Samuelson which aims at revealing the preference of consumers by monitoring their purchasing habits.Description: The theory basically seeks to study consumer behaviour. Samuelson made a basic assumption that a consumer, while making purchase decisions, evaluates a number of alternatives and chooses the product which best satisfies his needs, given the budget constraint.	Therefore, the product/service that he chooses to buy can be referred to as his preferred choice."
121,0,Reverse Repo Rate,"Definition: Reverse repo rate is the rate at which the central bank of a country (Reserve Bank of India in case of India) borrows money from commercial banks within the country. It is a monetary policy instrument which can be used to control the money supply in the country.Description: An increase in the reverse repo rate will decrease the money supply and vice-versa, other things remaining constant. An increase in reverse repo rate means that commercial banks will get more incentives to park their funds with the RBI, thereby decreasing the supply of money in the market.All that you wanted to know about Reverse Repo Rate..."
122,0,Risk,"Definition: Risk implies future uncertainty about deviation from expected earnings or expected outcome. Risk measures the uncertainty that an investor is willing to take to realize a gain from an investment.Description: Risks are of different types and originate from different situations. We have liquidity risk, sovereign risk, insurance risk, business risk, default risk, etc. Various risks originate due to the uncertainty arising out of various factors that influence an investment or a situation."
123,0,Risk Averse,"Definition: A risk averse investor is an investor who prefers lower returns with known risks rather than higher returns with unknown risks. In other words, among various investments giving the same return with different level of risks, this investor always prefers the alternative with least interest.Description: A risk averse investor avoids risks. S/he stays away from high-risk investments and prefers investments which provide a sure shot return. Such investors like to invest in government bonds, debentures and index funds."
124,0,Risk Lover,"Definition: Risk lover is a person who is willing to take more risks while investing in order to earn higher returns. When it comes to taking risk for earning returns, different people have different attitudes. Some are risk lovers, some risk averse and some are neutral towards risk.Description: Generally investments giving lower returns come with lower risks as well. On the other hand, investments giving higher returns involve higher risks.Example: A risk-averse person would prefer investing in fixed deposits, bonds, etc. as they involve lesser risk, whereas a risk lover would prefer investing his money in stocks as they have the potential to give higher returns than fixed deposits."
125,0,Risk Management,"Definition: In the world of finance, risk management refers to the practice of identifying potential risks in advance, analyzing them and taking precautionary steps to reduce/curb the risk.Description: When an entity makes an investment decision, it exposes itself to a number of financial risks. The quantum of such risks depends on the type of financial instrument. These financial risks might be in the form of high inflation, volatility in capital markets, recession, bankruptcy, etc.	So, in order to minimize and control the exposure of investment to such risks, fund managers and investors practice risk management. Not giving due importance to risk management while making investment decisions might wreak havoc on investment in times of financial turmoil in an economy. Different levels of risk come attached with different categories of asset classes.	For example, a fixed deposit is considered a less risky investment. On the other hand, investment in equity is considered a risky venture. While practicing risk management, equity investors and fund managers tend to diversify their portfolio so as to minimize the exposure to risk."
126,0,Satisficing,"Definition: This can be referred to as a phenomenon/strategy that strives for satisfactory decision making. It is aimed at taking decisions that are okay enough to tackle a situation, but not the best possible decisions.Description: Decision making is a very important aspect of business and the management must practice effective decision making to keep the company sound. But when the management has a number of alternatives at a juncture, it is not always possible for it to take the best possible decision as it requires increased efforts, costs and time.	 	In such a situation, the management might take a decision which is just 'good enough' to tackle the situation, thus devoting lesser resources to the problem. This act would be referred to as satisficing."
127,0,Scalability,"Definition: In the world of finance, scalability refers to the ability of a company to sustain or better its performance in terms of profitability or efficiency when its sales volume increases.Description: It is usually a big challenge for any company to maintain its profitability or efficiency when the volume of sales increases. Similarly, capital markets must have the ability to maintain their performance levels when the volumes of trade carried out by traders and investors rise. 	A company with a flexible and scalable system is the one which is able to withstand fluctuations in volume without harming its profitability or efficiency levels."
128,0,Scenario Analysis,"Definition: Scenario Analysis is a process to ascertain and analyze possible events that can take place in the future. This is an important tool in the world of finance and economics, and is used extensively to make projections for the future.Description: This constitutes an important tool for decision making in the financial world, be it at the macro or the micro level. It is used extensively in the financial world for forecasting and analyzing possible future events.	Mathematics/statistics play a crucial role in such analyses. Based on the conclusions arrived through the analysis, financial institutions prepare their action plan for the future and build their portfolios."
129,0,Search Costs,"Definition: A consumer behaving rationally strives hard to opt for better products or services. The costs involved in searching such products/services are search costs.Description: Any consumer exercising rational behaviour continues to search for better options only till the time the additional cost of searching is less than the marginal benefit which it provides. Search cost might not just always be in monetary terms, but the time and energy spent in searching better products also form a part of it. 	Some of the monetary elements that are categorized under search cost include the cost of acquiring information and also the opportunity cost of the time utilized for searching better options."
130,0,Seasonal Adjustment,"Definition: This is a technique aimed at analyzing economic data with the purpose of removing fluctuations that take place as a result of seasonal factors.Description: Seasonal adjustment of economic/time data plays a crucial role analyzing/judging the general trend. In the world of finance, comparison of economic data is of immense importance in order to ascertain the growth and performance of a company. In this process, seasonal factors might create big fluctuations in the pattern.	For example, sales of air conditioners are at their peak during summers and quite less during winters. Thus, to study the general trend of sales of air conditioners, the data needs to be seasonally adjusted."
131,0,Secondary Market,"Definition: This is the market wherein the trading of securities is done. Secondary market consists of both equity as well as debt markets.Description: Securities issued by a company for the first time are offered to the public in the primary market. Once the IPO is done and the stock is listed, they are traded in the secondary market. The main difference between the two is that in the primary market, an investor gets securities directly from the company through IPOs, while in the secondary market, one purchases securities from other investors willing to sell the same.	Equity shares, bonds, preference shares, treasury bills, debentures, etc. are some of the key products available in a secondary market. SEBI is the regulator of the same."
132,0,Securitization,"Definition: Securitization is a process by which a company clubs its different financial assets/debts to form a consolidated financial instrument which is issued to investors. In return, the investors in such securities get interest.Description: This process enhances liquidity in the market. This serves as a useful tool, especially for financial companies, as its helps them raise funds. If such a company has already issued a large number of loans to its customers and wants to further add to the number, then the practice of securitization can come to its rescue.	In such a case, the company can club its assets/debts, form financial instruments and then issue them to investors. This enables the firm to raise capital and provide more loans to its customers. On the other hand, investors are able to diversify their portfolios and earn quality returns."
133,0,Seigniorage,"Definition: Seigniorage is the difference between the value of currency/money and the cost of producing it. It is essentially the profit earned by the government by printing currency.Description: It can also be termed as a source of revenue for governments as the value of money printed is generally higher than the cost of producing it. As obvious, if the currency produced values more than the cost involved in its production, the government earns a profit. If the cost involved in its production crosses its value, then the government suffers a loss."
134,0,Seniority,"Definition: At the time of winding up or bankruptcy of a company, it needs to repay its debts. The order in which these are repaid is referred to as seniority.Description: All securities, be it bonds or shares, are issued by the company with a certain seniority attached to them. As obvious, senior debts need to be paid before the junior ones. Generally, bonds/debts are the securities to be repaid first in case of winding up of a company. 	These are followed by preference shares and last come the equity shares. In short, holders of 'senior' securities get the privilege of getting paid first, before the rest of the security holders."
135,0,Service Tax,"Definition: Service tax is a tax levied by the government on service providers on certain service transactions, but is actually borne by the customers. It is categorized under Indirect Tax and came into existence under the Finance Act, 1994.Description: In this case, the service provider pays the tax and recovers it from the customer. Service Tax was earlier levied on a specified list of services, but in the 2012 budget, its scope was increased. Services provided by air-conditioned restaurants and short term accommodation provided by hotels, inns, etc. were also included in the list of services.It is charged to the individual service providers on cash basis, and to companies on accrual basis. This tax is payable only when the value of services provided in a financial year is more than Rs 10 lakh. This tax is not applicable in the state of Jammu & Kashmir.Watch the video here to learn more about Service Tax"
136,0,Shareholder Value,"Definition: Shareholder value is the value enjoyed by a shareholder by possessing shares of a company. It is the value delivered by the company to the shareholder.Description: Increasing the shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company. So the management must have the interests of shareholders in mind while making decisions. The higher the shareholder value, the better it is for the company and management.
