0,0,360 Degree Feedback,"Definition: 360-degree feedback is a feedback process where not just your superior but your peers and direct reports and sometimes even customers evaluate you. You receive an analysis of how you perceive yourself and how others perceive you.Description:  Benefits of 360-degree feedback:To the individual:> This helps the person understand his or her own personality from an outsider's perspective > Development needs are revealedTo the team:> Increases communication between team members > Supports teamwork by involving team members in the development processTo the organization:>Better career development for employees > Improves customer service by having customers contribute to evaluation > Drives trainingHowever, should 360-degree feedback be linked to performance appraisals? Prevailing thought says that 360-degree feedback and performance appraisals should not be linked. If it is linked to compensation decisions, it may lose its power as a tool for development. The thinking is that when compensation is the outcome, individuals will quickly learn how to play the game of ""I'll scratch your back, if you scratch mine.""Further, if people do not get satisfactory ratings, morale can decrease when 360 is linked to performance appraisal mode. But when 360 is used purely for development, low scores tend to be viewed as constructive feedback.Also See: Competency Mapping, Conflict Management, Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP), Job Description, MBO, MBWA, Mentoring, Pink Slip, VRS"
1,0,Competency Mapping,"Definition: Competency mapping identifies an individual's strengths and weaknesses. The aim is to enable the person to better understand himself or herself and to point out where career development efforts need to be directed.Description: Competencies are derived from specific job families within the organization and are often grouped around categories such as strategy, relationships, innovation, leadership, risk-taking, decision-making, emotional intelligence, etc.So far as the way to go about for competency mapping is concerned, the first step is job analysis, where the company needs to list core competency requirements for the job concerned. The next step should be development of a competency scale for the job on the parameters previously identified.The actual mapping of employees can be a self-done exercise or done by others like superiors. It can also be done by using the 360-degree method where peers, first reports and customers also rate the employee.Also See: 360-Degree Feedback, Conflict Management, Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP), Job Description, MBO, MBWA, Mentoring, Pink Slip, VRS"
2,0,Employee Stock Option Plan,"Definition: An Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) is a benefit plan for employees which makes them owners of stocks in the company. ESOPs have several features which make them unique compared to other employee benefit plans. Most companies, both at home and abroad, are utilising this scheme as an essential tool to reward and retain their employees. Currently, this form of restructuring is most prevalent in IT companies where manpower is the main asset.Description: Abroad, ESOP (where the 'O' often stands for ownership) is seen when employees buy over the stock of an owner or promoter who is relinquishing charge. In India, ESOP is used largely to motivate employees to put in their best and in turn, help the company enjoy lower employee turnover and retain its talent pool. These two uses probably account for over two-thirds of all ESOPs now in existence, and their numbers are expected to increase with time.Interestingly, many companies abroad use ESOPs as a technique of corporate finance for a variety of purposes -- to finance expansion, to make an acquisition, to spin off a division, to take a company private, and so on. This has yet to catch on in India, perhaps because the scale of ESOP so far is too small for many of these uses.So far as the future of ESOPs in India is concerned, as more and more companies realise the need to retain their best talent in a world which would be dominated by companies with the best intellectual capital, this management technique would be the phenomenon of the new century.Also See: 360-Degree Feedback, Competency Mapping, Conflict Management, Job Description, MBO, MBWA, Mentoring, Pink Slip, VRSWatch the video here: "
3,0,Job Description,"Definition: Creating a job description is a key step in the hiring process. You must be able to accurately describe what a new employee will do in order to decide how to divide the work between yourself and your employee.Description: A job description is helpful in evaluating whether you need a full-time employee or a part-timer. It can form the basis of advertisements that you run, and can be used to present a clear picture of the job-to-job applicants. Finally, it can play a part in evaluating whether an employee has met the expectations you set.Also See: 360-Degree Feedback, Competency Mapping, Conflict Management, Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP), MBO, MBWA, Mentoring, Pink Slip, VRS"
4,0,Management By Walking Around,"Definition: It is Management by Walking Around. MBWA basically refers to managers spending some part of their time listening to problems and ideas of their staff, while wandering around an office or plant.Description: Management by Walking Around is a term coined by management guru Tom Peters. Apparently, from his study of successful companies and their practices, Tom Peters noticed that good managers tend to communicate a lot better with their team. And they do that in informal ways, like just hanging around in the office and chatting with them, rather than having formal interaction sessions in their cabins or boardrooms. Sam Walton, the founder of the largest company in the world, Walmart, was a great exponent of this practice. He believed in visiting as many of his stores as many times as possible and talking to frontline staff.The idea of this practice is to listen. You must also respond to ideas or problems voiced and take effective action about them.Also See: 360-Degree Feedback, Competency Mapping, Conflict Management, Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP), Job Description, MBO, Mentoring, Pink Slip, VRS"
5,0,Mbo,"Definition: MBO is a management practice which aims to increase organizational performance by aligning goals and subordinate objectives throughout the organization.Description: MBO requires all levels of management to agree on clearly defined quantitative and/or qualitative objectives. These targets then need to be periodically reviewed by higher levels of management.In other words, MBO involves focusing more on results rather than the activities involved. The top management is essentially negotiating a contract of goals with their subordinates without dictating a detailed roadmap for implementation.The MBO method is supposed to enhance organizational effectiveness by getting the organization to become more result focused. It is also supposed to encourage independence and entrepreneurism amongst line managers. This philosophy originated sometime in the early 1970s.Also See: 360-Degree Feedback, Competency Mapping, Conflict Management, Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP), Job Description, MBWA, Mentoring, Pink Slip, VRS"
6,0,Mentoring,"Definition: Mentoring is a relationship between a senior and a junior where the elder person guides the younger person through difficult times, gives advice and support. In an organization, the senior helps the junior through his early career. He gives guidance, suggests training if required, and helps make the right career choices.Description: In India, not too many organizations have an active mentoring programme. Hindustan Lever, the consumer goods leader, has had a celebrated mentoring programme. Every new management trainee is assigned a mentor. The mentor is supposed to meet the trainee on a regular basis and offer guidance.		Other than corporates, many colleges have mentoring programmes where either a faculty member or a senior is designated a mentor for new entrants. Mentoring programmes even exist at a social level in some countries.

7,0,Pink Slip,"Definition: If there's one colour that's in fashion these days, it's pink. But don't look to Paris for why. The current ubiquity of pink has its roots in the American expression 'pink slip' used to describe the termination notices issued by employers to employees. In these times of layoffs, the job place is awash in pink.People speculate about which company will let loose pink slips. They trade horror stories about how people got to know that they were getting pink slips (by email, by SMS, by a news item in the paper that the company was closing, by the queues of people outside the office waiting to buy the office PCs). Those who have got them go for pink slip parties where they sip pink champagne, eat pasta in pink sauce, and cake with pink frosting.There are pink slip support groups. At this moment, there are probably laid-off dotcommers writing angry novels about how the Pink Slip Generation was betrayed.Description: But why pink?The irony is that while the term has hit the big time, its origins are still a mystery. Peter Liebhold, a curator at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History who heads its work culture archive, has spent almost ten years trying to find the original pink slip - with no success. The term is not a new one. The first reference to it recorded by The Oxford English Dictionary goes as far back as 1915: ""And have Murphy hand me the pink slip tonight,"" urges one character in 'Covering The Look In Corner', a pulp novel with a baseball theme by Gilbert Patten, a prolific writer of the time.That reference suggests it was established slang, and sometime back Liebhold thought he had nailed down its origin. He came across a story tracing the term to the Ford Motor Company, where shop floor supervisors had a crude system of recording employee performance. Those they thought were worth keeping got a slip of white paper in the pigeonhole for their work card; those who saw a pink slip instead knew they might as well leave. Unfortunately, Liebhold was not able to find any evidence to back this, so has concluded the story is apocryphal.This lack of knowledge of pink slips is part of a wider problem. The study of the history of work has as yet paid little attention to the history of sackings or 'termination practices' as scholars refer to it. One of the few interesting bits of information is that different countries have used different colours.In Germany, those dismissed were said to 'get the blue letter' (den blauen Brief bekommen), while in France, military dischargees were said to have got their cartouche jaune, or yellow papers.Also See: 360-Degree Feedback, Competency Mapping, Conflict Management, Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP), Job Description, MBO, MBWA, Mentoring, VRS"
8,0,Voluntary Retirement Scheme,"Definition: Voluntary retirement scheme is a method used by companies to reduce surplus staff. This mode has come about in India as labour laws do not permit direct retrenchment of unionized employees.Description: VRS applies to an employee who has completed 10 years of service or is above 40 years of age. ?It should apply to all employees (by whatever name called), including workers and executives of a company or of an authority or of a co-operative society, excepting directors of a company or a co-operative society.It has to result in an overall reduction in the existing strength of employees. ?The vacancy caused by voluntary retirement is not to be filled up. The retiring employee shall not be employed in another company or concern belonging to the same management. The amount receivable on account of voluntary retirement of the employee does not exceed the amount equivalent to three months' salary for each completed year of service, or salary at the time of retirement multiplied by the balance months of service left before the date of retirement on superannuation of the employee. It is the last salary drawn which is to form the basis for computing the amount of payment.Most large public and private sector companies have implemented VRS in recent years.Also See: 360-Degree Feedback, Competency Mapping, Conflict Management, Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP), Job Description, MBO, MBWA, Mentoring, Pink Slip, VRS"
