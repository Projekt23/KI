0,0,52 Week High Low,"Definition: Prices of commodities, securities and stocks fluctuate frequently, recording highest and lowest figures at different points of time in the market. A figure recorded as the highest/lowest price of the security, bond or stock over the period of past 52 weeks is generally referred to as its 52-week high/ low.Description: It is an important parameter for investors (as they compare the current trading price of the stocks and bonds to the highest/lowest prices they have reached in the past 52 weeks) in making investment decisions. It also plays an important role in determination of the predicted future prices of the stock.Also See: Stock Price, Bond, Stock, Volatility"
1,0,Algorithm Trading,"Definition: Algorithm trading is a system of trading which facilitates transaction decision making in the financial markets using advanced mathematical tools.Description: In this type of a system, the need for a human trader's intervention is minimized and thus the decision making is very quick. This enables the system to take advantage of any profit making opportunities arising in the market much before a human trader can even spot them.	As the large institutional investors deal in a large amount of shares, they are the ones who make a large use of algorithmic trading. It is also popular by the terms of algo trading, black box trading, etc. and is highly technology-driven. It has become increasingly popular over the last few years.Also See: Automated Trading, High-Frequency Trading, Arbitrage"
2,0,Alpha,"Definition: Alpha is an estimated numeric value of a stock's expected excess return that cannot be attributed to the market's volatility, but may be due to some other security.Description: In other words, it is the difference between the investment return and the bench mark return (for e.g. NSE Nifty). It is one out of the five technical risk ratios which help the investor to determine the risk reward portfolio of the mutual fund.	Statistically, an alpha is generated by regressing a stock's excess return on benchmark (for example NSE Nifty) excess return. Alpha is an intercept. For example, if a stock has an alpha of 1.20, that means analysts expect 20% increase in the stock's price, not being affected by market fluctuations. Fundamental investors always want an alpha to be positive and beta to be zero.Also See: Beta, Alpha, Volatility, Alpha Shares"
3,0,American Option,"Definition: American options are derivatives contract with the option of redeeming the contract during the life of the option.Description: The unique feature of redeeming the contract before maturity or on the date of maturity gives it an added advantage of tradability. Due to this particular feature, it is the most widely traded option on trade exchanges. It is highly liquid in nature.	It is to be noted that the name of the option has nothing to do with the geographical locations and geographical names."
4,0,Arbitrage,"Definition: Arbitrage is the process of simultaneous buying and selling of an asset from different platforms, exchanges or locations to cash in on the price difference (usually small in percentage terms). While getting into an arbitrage trade, the quantity of the underlying asset bought and sold should be the same. Only the price difference is captured as the net pay-off from the trade. The pay-off should be large enough to cover the costs involved in executing the trades (i.e. transaction costs). Else, it won’t make sense for the trader to initiate the trade in the first place.Description: Suppose an asset, gold, is quoted at Rs 27,000 per 10 gm in the Delhi bullion market and at Rs 27,500 in the Mumbai bullion market. A trader may buy 10 gm of gold in Delhi and sell it in Mumbai, making a profit of Rs 500 (Rs 27,500 - Rs 27,000). However, this trade will be profitable only if the cost of transactions is less than Rs 500 per 10 gm of gold.In the above example, assuming that the total transaction cost, of executing the trades and physical delivery of gold, is Rs 200 for 10gm, then the net profit for the trader would reduce to Rs 300.If the price difference between the two bullion markets reduces to Rs 200 (or less than that) per 10gm of gold, then the arbitrage opportunity between the two markets shall cease to exist, as the transaction costs shall be equal to, or more than, the price difference between the two markets.In real life, arbitrage opportunities (if any) exist only for brief periods since most of the arbitrage trading has been taken over by algorithm-based trading in matured markets. These algorithms are quick to spot and capture arbitrage opportunity, making it easy for human traders to keep track.Watch the video here:"
5,0,Asset Allocation,"Definition: Asset allocation is an investment strategy by which an investor or a portfolio manager attempts to balance risk versus reward by adjusting the percentage of amount invested in an asset of a portfolio according to the risk tolerance of the investor, his/her goals and the investment time frame.Description: Financial assets vary in returns from each other depending on market conditions and user requirements. Almost all asset classes are not perfectly correlated with each other, so diversifying across multiple sectors tends to bring down the overall risk of a portfolio.Strategic Asset Allocation	This involves allocating fixed weights to various asset classes over the entire investment horizon. The return of the portfolio is then simply the weighted average return of various asset classes. For example, if you invest 60 per cent of your investments in stocks which have 15 per cent returns and 40 per cent in bonds which offer 5 per cent returns, then the mean return of the portfolio is 11 per cent.Tactical Asset Allocation	This strategy allows short term deviations from the ideal asset allocation to capitalize on market fluctuations or attractive investment opportunities that exist for a small period of time. The investor tends to remain moderately active and once the short term profits have been achieved the portfolio is rebalanced to the original mix.Dynamic Asset Allocation	This strategy is meant for active investors who monitor their portfolio on a regular basis. The investor tends to modify the allocation percentage of various assets depending upon the how the markets and the economy is fluctuating. User may shift the gains from a volatile asset to less risky assets when markets are correcting or may shift to riskier assets when the markets are booming."
6,0,Auction Market,"Definition: An auction market is the market where interested buyers and sellers enter ambitious bids and offers, respectively, at the same time. The price at which the security trade reflects the highest price the buyer is interested to pay and the lowest price at which the seller is interested to sell.	The trade is executed at the price where the bid and the offer price match. It is different from an over-the-counter (OTC) market where the trades are negotiated. Auction is also used in initial public offerings (IPOs). The type of auction used in IPOs is called Dutch auction. Auction is used in different stock exchanges around the world.Description: In simple terms, an auction market is the place where the highest price is defined by buyers and the lowest price is defined by sellers to place an order for a particular entity or service. The transaction is executed only if both the buyer and seller agree on the defined price or amount.	A standard example of an auction market is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Auction markets vary from one counter to another and trades are also negotiable at that place. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is one of the world’s leading auction markets.	For example, suppose 10 buyers want to buy a share of a company called ABC and make bids at Rs 10, Rs 20, Rs 30, Rs 40 till Rs 100.	On the other hand, there are 10 sellers who seek to sell the same shares at Rs 15, Rs 25, Rs 60, and Rs 120. Here, the transaction between the buyer and seller that made bids/offers for ABC company shares will be done at Rs 60. All other orders will not be made immediately and the minimum price of shares will then be Rs 60."
7,0,Basis Risk,"Definition: Basis Risk is a type of systematic risk that arises where perfect hedging is not possible. When there is a variation between hedge/futures/relative price and cash/spot price of the hedged underlying at any given point of time, that variation is called ‘Basis’ and risk associated with it is called Basis Risk.	Basis is simply the relationship between the cash price and future price of an underlying, and its variation happens when there is a difference in delivery location, quality and date/time. To mitigate the price risk of an acquired underlying trading in one market, a trader usually takes a counter or similar position in a relative or derivative market to give it a perfect hedge. But when there is imperfect hedging, basis risk arises. This happens mainly when proper matching or correlation testing of the underlying price and relative price or its properties is not done.	Basis = Spot price of hedged underlying – Hedged derivative (futures) price of the same underlying	Description: Basis Risk is the most important risk, which every hedger or trader considers while trading in the derivative market. It typically occurs when there is non-convergence of spot price and relative price on the offset date of trade due to an imperfect hedging strategy. When the offsetting properties are different, they add market risk to the trade, which is basically Basis Risk. And that non-convergence amount between cash price of the hedged underlying and price of the relative hedged underlying thus gives the numerical value for the basis risk, which can be negative or positive.	There are different types of Basis Risk in case of an imperfect hedging, which are listed below:	a)   Price Basis Risk: This occurs when there is a difference between spot price and relative future price or they do not move in tandem during the start and end of trade. Example, gold futures price is not changing as much gold spot price.	b)  Location Basis Risk: This happens typically in the commodities market, where the futures market delivery location (on which hedging is done) is different from that of the actual spot market (for which hedging is done). Example, crude oil futures price for Mumbai location is different from crude oil price for Singapore Spot.	c)    Calendar Basis Risk: In this case, the selling date of the spot market trade can be different from the expiry date of the futures market contract. For example, the date of selling HDFC Bank shares is 15 days prior to the expiry date of HDFC Bank futures contract on the NSE	d)  Product Quality Basis Risk: When the properties or qualities of the underlying asset are different from the relative underlying asset. Example, crude oil futures used to hedge ATF spot priceExample:	Support, the Tata Motors stock is trading at a spot price of Rs 355 while March futures are quoting at Rs 355.40. Now on the date of expiry, the stock falls to Rs 340 and futures to Rs 350. So, the basis weakened as it fell from -0.40 to -15, giving a profit of Rs 9.60 ((Rs 355-340)-(Rs 355.40-Rs 350)).	Had the stock price gone up to Rs 380 and the futures were at Rs 370; the basis would have strengthened from -0.40 to 10 but it would have led to a loss of -10.40 ((Rs 355-Rs 380)-(Rs 355.40-Rs 370)).	Further, Basis Risk is classified as strong basis or weak basis. As the basis varies during the course of the trade, at any point of time it strengthens when it gains in value and weakens when it loses value. Here are some of the cases which can explain this in detail.	I.     When the hedger is doing a short hedge, that would mean locking the price of the underlying which is sold but to be delivered in the future in order to avoid price fluctuation during that time.	·         Case 1 - Spot Price slides more than the futures price, in this case weak basis	 	Loss = ((Start date Cash Price – End date Cash Price) – (Hedge start price – Hedge end price))	 	·         Case 2 - Spot Price gains more than the Futures Price, again weak basis	 	Gain = ((Start date Cash Price – End date Cash Price) – (Hedge start price – Hedge end price))	 	·         Case 3 - Futures Price falls more than the Cash Price, case of strong basis 	 	Gain = ((Hedge start price – Hedge end price) – (Start date Cash Price – End date Cash Price))	 	·         Case 4 - Futures Price gains more than the Cash Price, case of weak basis	 	Loss = ((Hedge start price – Hedge end price) – (Start date Cash Price – End date Cash Price))	 	·         Case 5 - Futures Price gains or lose in tandem with the Spot Price, zero basis and no change	 	·         Case 6 - No change in spot price and futures price, zero basis and no change	II.  When the hedger does a long hedge, that means locking the price of the underlying which is bought but to be delivered in future, so as to avoid price fluctuation during that time.	·         Case 1 - Spot Price slides more than the Futures Price, in this case weak basis	 	Gain = ((Start date Cash Price – End date Cash Price) – (Hedge start price – Hedge end price))	 	·         Case 2 - Spot Price gains more than the Futures Price, case of strong basis	 	Loss = ((Start date Cash Price – End date Cash Price) – (Hedge start price – Hedge end price))	 	·         Case 3 - Futures Price falls more than the Cash Price, case of strong basis 	 	Loss = ((Hedge start price – Hedge end price) – (Start date Cash Price – End date Cash Price))	 	·         Case 4 - Futures Price gains more than the Cash Price, case of weak basis	 	Gain = ((Hedge start price – Hedge end price) – (Start date Cash Price – End date Cash Price)	 	·         Case 5 - Futures Price gains or lose in tandem with the Spot Price, zero basis and no change	 	·         Case 6 - No change in spot price and futures price, zero basis and no change	Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives fit the requirements of a hedger, as they can be tailor-made as per the hedging strategy, thus minimising the basis risk.

8,0,Bearish Trend,"Definition: 'Bearish Trend' in financial markets can be defined as a downward trend in the prices of an industry's stocks or the overall fall in broad market indices.Description: Bearish trend is characterized by heavy investor pessimism about the declining market prices scenario. A fall in the prices of about 20% is identified as a bearish trend.Also see: Bullish Trend, Squaring Off, Short Sell"
9,0,Bear Put Spread,"Definition: Traders use this strategy when they expect the price of an underlying to decline in the near future. This involves buying and selling Put options of the same expiry but different strike prices.	A higher strike price Put is bought and a lower priced one is sold. The higher priced Put is in-the-money (ITM) while a lower priced one is an out-of-the-money option. This strategy results in a net debit for the trader as the cost of the ITM Put gets adjusted with the cash flow from shorting the OTM Put.	The trader ends up making profit if the price of the underlying ends up lower than the strike price of the out-of-the-money Put. The profit arises from the higher intrinsic value of the high priced Put. The net profit thus equals the difference in strike prices minus the price paid to create the spread.	 	Profit = Strike price of long Put – strike price of short Put –chargesDescription:	This strategy also has a limited upside risk to it.	Case 1: Price rises above the ITM option	The loss equals the debit that occurred while creating the position. (Net difference in buying and selling the Put as both expire worthless)	Case 2: Price stays above the OTM option and less than the ITM option	There will be a loss in this case if the charges paid to create the position are more than the difference in the strike prices.	Suppose the stock of ABC was trading at Rs 100 in July. A trader bearish on ABC creates a bear Put spread. He/she buys a July 110 Put for Rs 300 and sells a July 95 for Rs 200. Thus, he/she has a net outflow of Rs 100 to create the position.	Now, if the price of ABC plummets to Rs 90 on expiry, it would make both the options in-the-money and the trader would make Rs 6,000 on the July 110 Put and lose Rs 1,000 on the July 95 put.	Deducting the initial amount of Rs 100 that went into creating the position, the profit for the trader will come to Rs 6,000-Rs 1,000-Rs 100=Rs 4,900.	 	If the price of ABC had gone to Rs 115 instead, both the options would have expired worthless, and the initial amount of Rs 100 would have been the net loss."
10,0,Beta,"Definition: Beta is a numeric value that measures the fluctuations of a stock to changes in the overall stock market.Description: Beta measures the responsiveness of a stock's price to changes in the overall stock market. On comparison of the benchmark index for e.g. NSE Nifty to a particular stock returns, a pattern develops that shows the stock's openness to the market risk. This helps the investor to decide whether he wants to go for the riskier stock that is highly correlated with the market (beta above 1), or with a less volatile one (beta below 1).For example, if a stock's beta value is 1.3, it means, theoretically this stock is 30% more volatile than the market. Beta calculation is done by regression analysis which shows security's response with that of the market.	By multiplying the beta value of a stock with the expected movement of an index, the expected change in the value of the stock can be determined. For example, if beta is 1.3 and the market is expected to move up by 10%, then the stock should move up by 13% (1.3 x 10).	Beta is the key factor used in the Capital Asset Price Model (CAPM) which is a model that measures the return of a stock. The volatility of the stock and systematic risk can be judged by calculating beta. A positive beta value indicates that stocks generally move in the same direction with that of the market and the vice versa.Also see: volatility, CAPM, NSE Nifty, alpha."
11,0,Bid-ask Spread,"Definition: Bid-Ask Spread is typically the difference between ask (offer/sell) price and bid (purchase/buy) price of a security. Ask price is the value point at which the seller is ready to sell and bid price is the point at which a buyer is ready to buy. When the two value points match in a marketplace, i.e. when a buyer and a seller agree to the prices being offered by each other, a trade takes place. These prices are determined by two market forces -- demand and supply, and the gap between these two forces defines the spread between buy-sell prices. The larger the gap, the greater the spread! Bid-Ask Spread can be expressed in absolute as well as percentage terms. When the market is highly liquid, spread values can be very small, but when the market is illiquid or less liquid, they can be large.Description: Calculation of Bid-Ask Spread:	Bid-Ask Spread (absolute) = Ask/Offer Price – Bid/Buy Price Bid-Ask Spread (%) = ((Ask/Offer Price- Bid/Buy Price) – Ask/Offer Price)*100	Example: Gold (December) futures contract on MCX has best buy price at Rs 26,473 and best sell price at Rs 26,478. So the Bid-Ask Spread is equal to (Rs 26,478-Rs 26,473) = Rs 5 and the percentage spread will be equal to ((5/26,478)*100) = 0.019% There can be various buyers and sellers in the market and they may be willing to buy/sell any security at different price points. So, all price points cannot be used to calculate Bid-Ask Spread. This can be calculated by using the lowest Ask Price (best sell price) and highest Bid Price (best buy price). The Bid-Ask Spread is one of the important trading points in the derivatives market and traders use it as an arbitrage tool to make little money by keeping a check on the ins and outs of Bid-Ask Spread.	Bid-Ask spread is used in following arbitrage trades:	1) Inter-market spread : When a trader buys the futures of a security having a particular expiry on one exchange and sells the same security contract with a near-expiry on another exchange,	2) Intra-market spread : When the contract of one security is bought and that of another security is sold on the same exchange e.g. gold and silver spread trade,	3) Calendar spread : When a security contract of one expiry date is bought and another contract of the same security with a different expiry date is sold on the same exchange.	Some of the important elements to Bid-Ask Spread: 1) The market for any security should be highly liquid, otherwise there may be no ideal exit point to book profit in a spread trade.	2) There should be some friction in demand-supply of that security, because that creates chances for a wider spread.	3) A trader should not use ‘market order’ for spread trade, otherwise the spread opportunity can be missed. It’s wise to use ‘limit order’ where the trader decides the entry point.	4) The range of a spread trade is relative to that particular security market, it’s not same for all.	5) Always check Bid-Ask Spread ins and outs, and look for spreads either in absolute or percentage terms for individual security. If it’s a margin trade, then use spread percentage.	6) Bid-Ask Spread trade involves a cost, as you are doing two trades simultaneously.	7) Bid-Ask Spread trades can be done in almost all kinds of securities, but they are quite popular in forex, interest rate yields and commodities.Souce : Sasha Evdakov"
12,0,Binary Options,"DEFINITION: A binary option is a type of derivative option where a trader makes a bet on the price movement of an underlying asset in near future for a fixed amount. Dictionary meaning of ‘binary’ suggests where a moment involves two or composed of two, in simple terms it can be expressed as true/false, yes/no or 0, 1 i.e. there are two outcomes. Similarly in binary option a trader has to bet on any one out of two options ‘buy/sell’ basis two definite outcomes whether an underlying asset price will rise or fall in the near future, for which a trader will earn fixed amount if bet worked in his favor.	In binary option for a trader a bet works if an option expires ‘in the money’ i.e. price of an underlying asset on any given future date closes more than the ‘strike price’ of an option of that particular underlying asset on that particular date. If an option is ‘out of money’ i.e. ‘strike price’ is more than the price of underlying asset on expiry date (date of consideration) then trader gets nothing out of that trade.	Binary options are also called as digital options, all or nothing options, one touch options, fixed return options and bet options.DESCRIPTION: Binary options underlying base is compulsorily cash only settlement on the date of expiry of an option. This works on the same lines like European style option. These options have a fixed payout for a trader, which has a maximum time limit considering the difference between the purchase date and exercise date of an option. An option automatically exercises or expires on the said date and it can’t be carried out on next expiry date, and the option holder can’t buy or sell the actual security. Binary option holder just bets on a proposition whether certain security price will rise or fall in future date basis that he/she buys/sells certain kind of option either call/put. If trader sees bullish trend then binary call option if bearish then binary put option.	These are important elements to any binary option:	 	1)      Cash settled	2)      Put/call option	3)      Expiry Date	4)      Underlying Asset and its price	5)      Settlement Price	Binary options are normally found in two formats,	Either cash or nothing binary options where trade is done on fixed amount i.e. if an option expires ‘in the money’ then option holder will get fixed cash amount on which particular trade was entered on, if ‘out of the money’ then zero cash.	Or asset or nothing binary options where trade is done asset value i.e. if an option expires ‘in the money’ then option holder will get amount equivalent to the market value of an underlying on which particular trade was entered on, if ‘out of the money’ then zero value.Examples:	A trader thinks the Reliance Industries stock will touch Rs 950 in a month’s time. Through a broker, who deals in binary option, he buys a ‘cash or nothing’ binary call option of RIL with fixed a binary payoff of Rs 500. Now, he buys one lot of one month call option at strike price of Rs 950, which is expiring on Nov 27. Now on the expiry date i.e. Nov 27, RIL shares close at Rs 955, which means the option expired ‘in the money’. So the trader will receive Rs 500. Had the stock closed below Rs 950, the option holder would have received no money.	Worldwide binary options for below-mentioned securities are found:	·   Index – Dow Jones, Nikkei, Nasdaq	·   Stocks –Binary options of all popular stocks like Cisco, Google are available for trade	·   Forex – Combinations of all major currencies such as USD, EUR, GBP, JPY and AUD just to name a few	·   Interest rates – Generally, fixed return options found in the US where hourly, daily, monthly contracts are available	·   Commodities – Gold, silver, crude oil	A binary option is different from any classic options, be it call or put option, why?	Some of the advantages of binary options are:	Trading is hassle-free as the trader has to track underlying security trend only and speculate on same	No actual buying/selling of stocks or commodities or any underlying asset	Binary options have fixed payouts, so it’s a informed decision where reward and risk is defined	Binary options can be used for intraday speculative trading and hedging of physical trades for short term.	Binary options contracts are offered with different short duration time periods, so traders have broad range to choose from seconds to months depending on their requirement	In some countries, binary options are traded on regulated exchanges, but generally they are termed risky around the world because they are unregulated and are traded through fraudulent ways through the medium of brokers over the internet. All major exchanges alert investors against such systems. In India Sebi doesn’t allow binary options on regulated derivative exchanges and they are illegal. Major European exchanges offer binary options in various securities, such as EUREX, and they are quite popular. CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade) allows selective binary options trading on Fed Funds Rate to members only. NADEX (North American Derivatives Exchange aka Hedge Street) formally allows US-regulated binary options on major securities like forex pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD), commodities like gold & crude oil and it requires special bank accounts under the jurisdiction of CFTC regulations.

13,0,Black-scholes Model,"Definition: Black-Scholes is a pricing model used to determine the fair price or theoretical value for a call or a put option based on six variables such as volatility, type of option, underlying stock price, time, strike price, and risk-free rate.	The quantum of speculation is more in case of stock market derivatives, and hence proper pricing of options eliminates the opportunity for any arbitrage. There are two important models for option pricing – Binomial Model and Black-Scholes Model.	The model is used to determine the price of a European call option, which simply means that the option can only be exercised on the expiration date.Description: Black-Scholes pricing model is largely used by option traders who buy options that are priced under the formula calculated value, and sell options that are priced higher than the Black-Schole calculated value (1).	The formula for computing option price is as under (2):	Call Option Premium C = SN(d1) - Xe- rt N(d2)	Put Option Premium P = Xe–rT N (–d2) – S0 N (-d1)	d1 = [Ln (S / X) + (r + s2 / 2) X t]	--------------------------------------	s Öt	d2 = [Ln (S / X) + (r - s 2 / 2) X t]	---------------------------------------	s Öt	Here,	C = price of a call option	P = price of a put option	S = price of the underlying asset	X = strike price of the option	r = rate of interest	t = time to expiration	s = volatility of the underlying	N represents a standard normal distribution with mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1"
14,0,Block Deal,"Definition: It is a single transaction, of a minimum quantity of five lakh shares or a minimum value of Rs 5 crore, between two parties which are mostly institutional players. The transaction happens through a separate trading window. The deals happen in the beginning of trading hours for a time span of 35 minutes.Description: Block deal order consists of the following attributes:	1. An order may be placed for a minimum quantity of 5 lakh equity shares or minimum value of Rs 5 crore.	2. Every trade has to result in delivery and ""Block Deal"" orders cannot be squared off or reversed.	3. The price of a share ordered at the window should range within +1% to -1% of the current market price/previous day's closing price, as applicable.	4. Transparent disclosure of trade transaction details such as the name of scrip, name of the clients (Buyer and Seller), quantity of shares bought/sold, and traded price have to be made by the broker to the exchange immediately. The exchange has to furnish all the transaction-related information to the public markets on the same day of the block deal transaction, after the closing of trading hours.For example, two FIIs (foreign institutional investors) want to trade 10% of a company's total number of shares. As this transaction involves trading of a large quantity of shares, the risk factors entailing to this transaction are immense. Thereby, the exchange on which trading will happen, allocates a separate trading window for these two investors to exhibit a block deal, with the prime focus of prohibiting risk.Also see: Bulk Deals, FII, SEBI"
15,0,Blue Chip Stocks,"Definition: Blue chip stocks are shares of very large and well-recognised companies with a long history of sound financial performance. These stocks are known to have capabilities to endure tough market conditions and give high returns in good market conditions. Blue chip stocks generally cost high, as they have good reputation and are often market leaders in their respective industries.Description: Oliver Gingold, who worked at Dow Jones, coined the phrase ‘Blue Chip’ in 1923. This term came into vogue after Gingold, while standing near the stock ticker at a brokerage firm, noticed that several stocks traded at $200 or more per share. He called them ‘Blue Chip Stocks’ and wrote an article on them. That’s how the phrase was born. Since then the term has been used to refer to highly-priced stocks, but now it is used more commonly to refer to high-quality stocks. These are stocks that generally deliver superior returns in the long run. Some people also relate blue chip stocks to blue betting disks in the game of poker, where the blue disk has the highest value while the white one has the lowest. Several parameters can be considered to identify blue chip companies. They include consistent annual revenue over a long period, stable debt-to-equity ratio, average return on equity (RoE) and interest coverage ratio besides market capitalisation and price-to-earnings ratio (PE). As per market capitalisation, India’s leading blue chip companies today are State Bank of India (SBI), Bharti Airtel, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Coal India, Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, ONGC, ITC, Sun Pharma, GAIL (India), Infosys, and ICICI Bank."
16,0,Bollinger Bands,"Definition: Bollinger Bands is one of the popular technical analysis tools, where three different lines are drawn, with one below and one above the security price line. Its specific period moving average is denoted as midline to form an ‘envelope’. These lines show a band or a volatility range in which a particular security price is moving up or down. Volatility is shown on the basis of standard deviation for a particular security, which is denoted by upper and lower line/band,  as standard deviation is a measure of volatility. Bollinger Bands was developed by John Bollinger in the mid 1980s and he trademarked this term in 2011. Initially, it was called trading bands, but later on, John Bollinger evolved this concept and called it Bollinger Bands.Description: Bollinger Bands shows the levels of different highs and lows that a security price has reached in a particular duration and also its relative strength, where highs are near to the upper line and lows are near to lower line. In other words, the price points near the edges of the ‘envelope’  formed can help us recognise a pattern at a particular moment. The bandwidth widens and narrows depending on volatility. If it’s high, the band would widen and if the volatility decreases, then the band would narrow. These bands show oversold and overbought conditions in relation to a selected time period moving average.	Bollinger Bands are somewhat like moving average envelopes, but drawing calculations for both is different. In Bollinger Bands, standard deviation levels are considered to draw the upper and lower lines, whereas for Moving Average Envelopes, the lines are plotted by taking a fixed percentage.	Calculation: For calculation of Bollinger Bands, the following variables are required:      	a)      Time Period denoted -- ‘N’	b)      Standard Deviation value -- ‘s’	c)      Three Bollinger bands or lines where:	1.      Moving Average Line or Middle Band for ‘N’ period MA (N). Refer average ‘Moving Average’ concept for calculation	2.      Upper Band or line wherein MA line is shifted up by price standard deviation  for ‘N’ period multiplied by SD measure value ‘D’ (MA + D(s))	3.      Lower Band or line where in MA line is shifted below by price standard deviation  for ‘N’ period multiplied by SD measure value ‘D’ (MA – D(s))	For different securities, different variable settings can be chosen. Typically traders use 20-day simple moving average with a standard deviation of 2. Some traders may use exponential moving average too.  	Example: Taking normal parameters used for drawing Bollinger Bands, we choose:	·         Security: Nifty 50	·         Data set: Daily close value	·         Moving Average: 20-Day simple moving average	·         Standard Deviation measure value (D): 2	·         Standard Deviation for price calculated for 20-day period	·         Filled Range	·         Here the green line is the upper band, showing standard deviation above the moving average, which is a 20-day simple MA + (20-Day SD of price x 2)	·         The blue line is middle band showing 20-day simple MA	·         The red line is lower band showing standard deviation below moving average, which is the 20-day simple MA + (20-Day SD of price x 2)http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/technical-charts	The band was widest when Nifty50 was volatile during July, the band narrowed when Nifty50 was consolidating during September.	Some important points for interpretation of Bollinger Bands:	·      When bands are contracting, there are chances of sharp price changes as volatility is drops	·      When price line surpasses the bands’ range, that a strong signal of continuation of the current trend	·      When new highs and lows are made outside the bands followed by highs and lows made inside the bands, it shows an imminent trend reversal	·      If a move originating in one band tends to replicate on the other band too, it is useful in deciding future price targets	·      When the price moves near the upper band, that shows an overbought market, and when the prices are nearer to the lower band, that signals an oversold market	·      M-patterns is one of the signal created by Arthur Merrill as an extension to Bollinger Bands to identify M-Tops, which shows signs of confirmation when prices are making new highs	·      W-Bottoms, again Arthur Merrill’s work to identify W-Bottoms to determine the strength when prices are making new lows	·      Use of Bollinger Bands varies with different traders. Some traders may buy when price are near the lower Bollinger Bands	·      Traders tend to exit when price line touches the middle line	·      Traders may buy when the price line breaks above the upper band and sell when price falls below the lower bandSource YouTube channel: Renegadetrader"
17,0,Bonus Share,"Definition: Bonus shares are additional shares given to the current shareholders without any additional cost, based upon the number of shares that a shareholder owns. These are company's accumulated earnings which are not given out in the form of dividends, but are converted into free shares.Description: The basic principle behind bonus shares is that the total number of shares increases with a constant ratio of number of shares held to the number of shares outstanding. For instance, if Investor A holds 200 shares of a company and a company declares 4:1 bonus, that is for every one share, he gets 4 shares for free. That is total 800 shares for free and his total holding will increase to 1000 shares.	Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation and increase their equity base. When price per share of a company is high, it becomes difficult for new investors to buy shares of that particular company. Increase in the number of shares reduces the price per share. But the overall capital remains the same even if bonus shares are declared.Also See: Stock Split, Stock, EquityWhat are bonus shares? Watch video..."
18,0,Bulk Deal,"Definition: A bulk deal is said to have happened if under a single client code and in a single or multiple transactions more than 0.5 per cent of a company's equity shares are traded. A bulk deal can be implemented within the trading hours at any point of time.Description: Bulk deal order consists of the following attributes:	1. The order should comprise of buying/selling of at least 0.5% of the total number of equity shares of a company, listed in a particular 'scrip' or exchange.	2. The broker who manages and implements the trade transaction is solely responsible for notifying about the bulk deals on a daily basis to the particular exchange. The broker is supposed to supply the exchange with the following details and attributes of the order: Name of the scrip, name of the client, quantity of shares bought/sold and the traded price.	a. If the bulk deal comprises of a single trade transaction: The broker has to notify exchange immediately.	b. If the bulk deal comprises of multiple transactions: The broker should notify the exchange within one hour from the closure of the trading.	3. The trade executed must result in delivery and shall not be squared off or reversed.	4. According to SEBI, optimal trading and settlement activities, surveillance and risk regulation measures which are applicable to common trading activities are applicable and exhibited in the trading windows also.	5. The exchange has to 'disseminate' or share the entire information about the bulk deal in the public market after the closing of trading hours on the same day of the implementation of the bulk deal.	Usually institutional players like mutual funds, asset management companies, insurance companies, banks, and venture capital companies participate in bulk deals.Also See: Block Deals, SEBI"
19,0,Bullish Trend,"Definition: A 'trend' in financial markets can be defined as a direction in which the market moves. 'Bullish Trend' is an upward trend in the prices of an industry's stocks or the overall rise in broad market indices, characterized by high investor confidence.Description: A bullish trend for a certain period of time indicates recovery of an economy.Also See: Bearish Trend, Squaring Off, Long, Inflation"
20,0,Bull Spread,"Definition: Bull Spread is a strategy that option traders use when they try to make profit from an expected rise in the price of the underlying asset. It can be created by using both puts and calls at different strike prices. Usually, an option at a lower strike price is bought and one at a higher price but with the same expiry date is sold in this strategy.Description: In the graphic example shown below, the user has bought a long call at strike price 60 and shorted (sold) a long call at strike price of 65.	Maximum gain = High strike price - lower strike price - net premium paid	Should the stock exceed the higher strike price, the investor would exercise the long call while the short call would expire worthless. Similarly, if the stock falls below the lower strike price, the investor would exercise the short call while the long call would go worthless. Thus, the difference between the two strike prices minus the premiums paid is the maximum profit one can make in this trade.	The maximum loss in this trade is capped at the premiums paid for both the calls and it can be incurred only if the stock price plummets below the lower strike price on expiry.	Breakeven: The breakeven occurs when on expiry the price of the underlying rises above the strike price of the long call by an amount equal to the net premium paid initially to buy the strategy.	Breakeven = long call strike + net debit paid	The strategy will always require an initial investment, as the strike price of the call shorted is higher than that of the call bought. This strategy works much like a standalone long call. However unlike the latter, the potential for profit in the first case is capped due to the short call premium. To increase the profit ceiling, you may go for a call at a higher strike price. However the premium received will be smaller as you increase the strike price."
21,0,Butterfly Spread Option,"Definition: Butterfly Spread Option, also called butterfly option, is a neutral option strategy that has limited risk. The option strategy involves a combination of various bull spreads and bear spreads. A holder combines four option contracts having the same expiry date at three strike price points, which can create a perfect range of prices and make some profit for the holder. A trader buys two option contracts – one at a higher strike price and one at a lower strike price and sells two option contracts at a strike price in between, wherein the difference between the high and low strike prices is equal to the middle strike price. Both Calls and Puts can be used for a butterfly spread.	Any butterfly option strategy involves the following:	1) Buying or selling of Call/Put options	2) Same underlying asset	3) Combining four option contracts	4) Different strike prices, with two contracts at same strike price	5) Same expiry dateDescription: The Butterfly Spread Option strategy works best in a non-directional market or when a trader doesn’t expect the security prices to be very volatile in future. That allows the trader to earn a certain amount of profit with limited risk. The best result of the strategy can be seen when it’s near to expiry and at the money, i.e. the price of the underlying is equal to the middle strike price. In this strategy, either you go for Calls or Puts or a combination of both. In the same way, you either go long or short on options or a combination of longs and shorts depending on what you are foreseeing in future and what is your payoff strategy.Example: Suppose, a trader is expecting some bullishness in Reliance Industries, when it trades at Rs 1,000. Now, a trader enters a long butterfly bull spread option by buying one lot each of December expiry Call options at strike prices Rs 980 and Rs 1,020 at values of 21.15 (980 Call) and 5.20 (1,020 Call) and then sell lots of Calls at strike price Rs 1,000 at 11.30. The cost to the trader at this point would be 3.75 (21.15+5.20-(2(11.30)). If the strategy fails, this will be the maximum possible loss for the trader. If the Reliance Industries stock trades at the same level (i.e. Rs 1,000) on the expiry date in December end, the Call option at the higher strike price will expire worthless as out-of-the-money (strike price is more than the trading price), while the Call option at the lower strike price will be in-the-money (strike price is less than trading price) and the two at-the-money Call options that had been sold expired worthless.	On expiry, the payout of the butterfly option will be (Rs 1,000-Rs 980) = Rs 20. Now subtracting the initial cost of Rs 3.75, the profit will be Rs 16.25 per lot. Further commission and exchange fees will be deducted to arrive at the actual profit/loss.	But if the trader decides to exit this strategy before expiry, say, when the Reliance Industries stock is trading around Rs 980 in cash market, and the Call options are trading at 40 (Rs 980), 5 (Rs 1000) and 0.6 (Rs 1020), the payout will be:	Call Option (980) – (40-21.15) = 18.85 (Profit)	Call Option (1000) – 2*(11.30-5) = 12.60 (Profit)	Call Option (1000) – (0.60-5.2) = -4.60 (Loss)	Net Profit & Loss = 26.85 minus commission and exchange taxes	In the above example, when the cash price is equal to the middle strike price, the trader will earn the maximum profit, but if the cash price is between the high and low strike prices, the variability of earning profit remains due to trading costs and taxes and there can be a chance that the trader will incur loss because of high trading cost.	There are various risks to this strategy, which include:	1) Higher implied volatility in case of long butterfly and lower implied volatility in case of short butterfly	2) Long expiry time as sentiments in the market can change	3) Shorting option in this combination can work in reversal in case of some events related to security	4)  Expiry of out-of-the-money options in case of all Calls or Puts or delivery on expiry date can work in reverse for this strategy	5) Higher trading costs, commissions and taxes	Long Call/Put Butterfly: This means buying one Call/Put option at higher strike price and one at lower strike price, and simultaneously selling two Calls/Puts at a strike price near to the cash price of the same expiry and underlying asset (index, commodity, currency, interest rate). This strategy involves limited risk, as the maximum amount the trader can lose is the cost of Call/Put options and it will occur when the cash price trades beyond the range of high and low strike prices at expiry. The maximum profitability will be when the cash price is equal to the middle strike price on the expiry day. The breakeven points for this strategy are:	Upper Breakeven Point = Higher strike price long Call/Put option (Strike Price - Premium paid (Value of option)	 	Lower Breakeven Point = Lower strike price long Call/Put option (Strike Price + Premium paid (Value of option)	Short Call/Put Butterfly: This means selling one Call/Put option at higher strike price and one at lower strike price, and simultaneously buying two Calls/Puts at a strike price near to cash price of the same underlying asset (index, commodity, currency, interest rates) and of same expiry. The maximum a trader may lose is the strike price of long Call/Put options and that will occur when the cash price is at the same level. The maximum profit will be when the cash price is beyond the range of lower and higher strike prices on the expiry day. The breakeven points of this strategy are:	Upper Breakeven Point = Higher strike price long Call/Put option (Strike Price - Premium paid (Value of option)	 	Lower Breakeven Point = Lower strike price long Call/Put option (Strike Price + Premium paid (Value of option)	Source YouTube Channel: Option Alpha"
22,0,Call Option,"Definition: Call option is a derivative contract between two parties. The buyer of the call option earns a right (it is not an obligation) to exercise his option to buy a particular asset from the call option seller for a stipulated period of time.Description: Once the buyer exercises his option (before the expiration date), the seller has no other choice than to sell the asset at the strike price at which it was originally agreed. The buyer expects the price to increase and thus earns capital profits."
23,0,Capital Protection Fund,"Definition: Capital protection-oriented fund is a class of closed-end hybrid fund. Its primary objective is to safeguard investors’ capital in the event of market downturns while simultaneously providing them scope for capital appreciation by participating in upturns of the equity market. The capital protection, however, is not guaranteed in India.Description: Capital protection-oriented funds are closed-end mutual fund schemes with a portfolio that is skewed towards debt. Because it is closed-end, fresh units of the scheme will be available for subscription only during the new fund offer (NFO) period. Subsequent purchase and sale of units is possible only on the exchange platform, where the fund is listed. However, this is easier said than done, as secondary market transaction can often become a Herculean task in the absence of sufficient liquidity. 	The portfolio comprises of a mix of equity and debt, typically of the nature of a hybrid fund. However, it is heavily oriented towards debt (especially zero coupon debt) and only a small part of the portfolio is invested in equity. The maturity of the debt portfolio is aligned with the lock-in period of the fund, thereby insulating it from the gyrations of interest rate movements. As debt instruments are held till maturity, the probability of marked-to-market losses due to interest rate fluctuations is mitigated. 	The primary objective of managing the debt portion of the portfolio is to safeguard investors’ capital. The capital protection orientation of the fund means that the debt component will be managed in such a manner that the returns from it increase to the level of initial capital invested. At the same time, the equity portion of the portfolio is managed with the aim to provide a fillip to the overall portfolio value. For instance, if the minimum debt exposure is fixed at 80 per cent, then this is managed to generate 100 per cent of the principal invested. The remaining 20 per cent comprising equity is managed to generate an upside to the portfolio. The portfolio is normally invested in highest grade debt instruments. 	These funds provide superior downside risk protection during a market downturn but offer limited upside during market upturns. They are suitable for conservative investors with a low risk appetite. These funds provide even the most conservative investors an opportunity to invest a small part of their portfolio in equity, thereby giving them the scope to participate in equity market upturns."
24,0,Cash & Carry Trade,"Definition: Cash and carry trade is an arbitrage strategy which involves buying the underlying asset of a futures contract in the spot market and carrying it for the duration of the arbitrage. Traders use this strategy to take advantage of the difference between the price of the underlying security and its corresponding futures price. The trade in this strategy will be profitable as long as the purchase price plus the cost of carry is less than the money received by selling the futures contract before it expires.Description: Cash and carry trade is also known as basis trading, where basis is defined as the difference between the spot price of an asset and its corresponding futures price. The idea behind the strategy is to manipulate the price difference to gain profits. 	Let’s understand this with an example.	Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $80 per share. However, there is an S&P 1 futures contract for delivery after one year from now and priced at $100. So, traders notice this difference and engage in ‘Cost and Carry’ trade and perform the following steps. 	1. Buy one share of XYZ for at a spot price of $80	2. Short one S&P 1 contract for $100 (futures price)	3. Hold on to one share of XYZ from the transaction in Step 1 and then deliver it into the short futures contract.	Now, the difference between future price and spot price is $100-$80=$20. The profit becomes $20 and the rate of return in cash and carry is $20/$100 = 20 per cent	(Assuming no transaction costs, holding costs, or dividend payout on stocks)"
25,0,Circuit Breakers,"Definition: Circuit breakers are pre-defined values in percentage terms, which trigger an automatic check when there is a runaway move in any security or index on either direction. The values are calculated from the previous closing level of the security or the index.	Usually, circuit breakers are employed for both stocks and indices. Many steps can possibly be taken after the breach of the circuit breakers.Some of the popular ones are:	1. Halting of trade in a security or index for a certain period	 	2. Halting of trade in a security or index for the entire trading day.	In case of the first option, trading in the security is halted for a few minutes to few hours to allow trading activity to cool down among the market participants. This time period also allows market participants to absorb any sudden news development in a particular security or a set of securities and, thereafter, take a rational and measured approach towards the security during the rest of the trading session.	If the volatility or big moves are still not controlled when trading resumes after a temporary halt, then the second option is invoked and trading is halted for the entire day.	The percentage levels at which these circuit breakers are invoked are revised regularly, depending on the levels of the security or the index over a period. For example, a stock may have a circuit breaker at 20 per cent for certain period and, subsequently, it can be revised downward to 10 per cent as the stock exchange may deem fit.Drawback:	1. The first downside of circuit breakers is that they prevent true price discovery in a stock both on its way up or down, at least for the limited time period they are imposed.	 	2. Secondly, they allow early investors (usually well-informed institutions or algo traders) to gain advantage and make a move before circuit breakers are eventually invoked, thereby restricting the moves of other investors, who make a move a little later in the day (usually retail investors).Description: Circuit breakers are in place for various stocks on the Indian bourses. The usual values of these are 2 per cent, 5 per cent, 10 per cent or 20 per cent. Stocks that are traded in the derivatives segment do not have any circuit breakers. On the Indian stock exchanges, an index-based market-wide circuit breaker system applies at three stages of the index movement on either side, viz. at 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 20 per cent. These circuit breakers, when triggered, bring about a coordinated trading halt in all equity and equity derivative markets nationwide. Market-wide circuit breakers are triggered by movement of either the BSE Sensex or the Nifty50, whichever hits the trigger first.	After index-based market-wide circuit filter is breached, the market re-opens with a pre-open call auction session. The extent of the duration of the market halt and pre-open session is as given below:-"
26,0,Collar Options,"Definition: The Collar Options strategy involves holding of shares of an underlying security while simultaneously buying protective Puts and writing Call options for the same underlying. It is technically identical to the Covered Call Strategy with the cushion of a Protective Put. The addition of a Protective Put safeguards the investor from large losses due to unexpected exponential fall in the price of the underlying. In a Covered Call strategy, the quantum of risk embedded in the trade is limited but large. An option trader can hedge the risk of loss by buying a Put option. For this reason, Option Collars are also called Hedge Wrappers. In this strategy, the quantum of both risk and reward is limited.  The outlook of the Collar Options trader for an underlying security is neutral.  	Description: In a Call option trade, the two counterparties involved are a Call Option writer and a Call Option buyer. The two parties have counter-views on the direction of the security price. The Call Option buyer believes the price of the underlying security is going to rise while the Call Option writer feels the price of the underlying security is going to fall.	An option writer is bound to sell the underlying at the same strike price in which the option buyer exercises his right. The option buyer will exercise his right only if it has an intrinsic value. For a Call option buyer, an option has an intrinsic value if the Strike price is less than the market price of the underlying. For a Call Option writer with an opposing view, the option will be in the money if the strike price is higher than the market price of the underlying.	Hence, contrary to the belief of the Call option writer, if the market price of the underlying heads northward, then the quantum of loss he incurs also rises simultaneously. Therefore, theoretically, the quantum risk ingrained in the trade is unlimited for him.	If the market price of the underlying declines in accordance with the belief of the Call option writer, he stands a chance to earn a profit from the trade.  However, the maximum profit potential is limited to the premium he receives from writing the Call option. As maximum profit is limited to the premium earned, Call option writers trade out of the money options whose premium tends to be high.   	Scenario:	1.      Trade: Write a call	2.      Outlook of the underlying security for the option writer: Bearish	3.      Risk: Unlimited	4.      Reward: Limited	5.      Break-even point: Strike price plus premium received from selling the Call. 	A Collar Options strategy is identical to a Covered Call strategy. In this strategy, an option trader writes a Call option while simultaneously buying shares of the underlying. An option trader resorts to this strategy when his outlook about the underlying ranges from neutral to slightly bullish. The quantum of risk emanating from a decline in the market price of the underlying is limited, but substantial. The quantum of profit is also limited as the option trader foregoes the probability of earning increased profits by writing the Call option. The breakeven point of the trade is equal to the purchase price of the underlying price minus the premium received.	In this strategy	Maximum profit is equal to	Premium received + strike price of the Call option – Purchase price of the underlying	Maximum profit is attained when the price of the underlying is higher than the strike price of the Call option. Loss is incurred when the price of the underlying is less than its purchase price adjusted for premiums received.  	In the Collar strategy, the option trader resorts to a Covered Call strategy as explained above with the addition of a Protective put. Thus, the complete strategy employed here is buying the shares of an underlying while simultaneously writing Call options and buying protecting puts. Both the Call and Put options are out of the money options with the same expiry date and equal in terms of the number of contracts.	In a Put Option trade, the counterparties remain the same as a Call Option trade. But their views about the direction of the price of the underlying security change. The Put option buyer believes that the price of the security is going to fall while the Put option writer believes that the price of the underlying security is going to rise. If the strike price is more than the current market price of the underlying, then the Put option is said to be in the money. This means it has some intrinsic value which makes it worthy for the Put option buyer to exercise his right.      	Scenario	1.      Trade: Buy a Put	 	2.      Outlook of the underlying security for the option buyer: Bearish	 	3.      Risk: Limited	 	4.      Reward: Limited	 	5.      Break-even point: Strike price minus premium paid 	 	The purchase of a Put option protects the option trader against sharp downward movement in the price of the underlying. This is because the Put option buyer will exercise his option when it has an intrinsic value, meaning when the strike price is higher than the price of the underlying.	In this strategy	The maximum profit is equal to	Strike price of the Short Call - Purchase price of the Underlying + Net premium received adjusted for commissions	Maximum profit is attained when the price of the underlying is greater than or equal to the strike price of the short call.	The maximum loss is equal to 	Purchase price of the underlying – strike price of the long Put - net premium received adjusted for commissions	Maximum loss is incurred when the price of the underlying is less than or equal to the strike price of the long Put. 	Let us suppose an options trader buys 100 shares of a stock X trading at a market price of Rs 30 per share in December. He decides to create a Collar by writing an out of the money Call in January series at the strike price of 33 for Rs 5. At the same time, he buys an out of the money January Put option at a strike price of 28 for Rs 3.	So, he pays Rs 3,000 (100*30) for buying the shares and Rs 300 (100*3) for the Put.  He receives Rs 500 (100*5) for writing the Call option. So, the total cost for the trade is equal to (3,000+300-500) equal Rs 2,800.Scenario 1	Let us suppose that stock price rose to Rs 35. In this case, the trader would have realised the value of his stock holding rose to (100*35) = Rs 3,500.	As he is the seller of Call option, he expected the price of the underlying to fall. But its price has in fact risen.  The Call option buyer will exercise his right and will buy the Call option at the strike price of 33, which is lower than the price of the underlying that is 35. So the option seller received (33*100) = Rs 3,300 by selling the Call option.	For a Put option buyer, an option is in the money if the strike price is higher than the price of the underlying. In this case, as the strike price of 28 is less than the CMP of the underlying, which is 35, and thus the option is rendered worthless for him.      	Net profit from the transaction = Rs 3,500 – Rs 3,300 +500 -300 = 400Scenario 2	Now assume that the price of the underlying fell to Rs 20 on the day of expiry. In that case, value of the stock holding of the option trader falls to (100*20) equals Rs 2,000. As he is the seller of Call option, the movement of the underlying is in line with his expectations. The buyer of the Call option will exercise his right if the strike price is less than the price of the underlying. In this case, the strike price of Rs 33 is greater than the CMP of Rs 20. Hence, he will not exercise his right. The option writer will have to be contended with the premium that he received from the transaction that is Rs 500 (5*100).	However, he is also the buyer of a protective Put. For the buyer of a Put option, his option is in the money if the strike price is higher than the price of the underlying. In this case, the strike price of Rs 28 is higher than the CMP of Rs 20. Hence, he will exercise his right. Therefore, he will sell the underlying at Rs 28 instead of Rs 20 to earn a profit of Rs (2,800-2,000) = Rs 800.	Factoring in the premium, the profit from the option trade is equal to Rs 1,000 (800+500-300)  "
27,0,Contra Fund,"Definition: A contra fund is defined by its against-the-wind kind of investing style. The manager of a contra fund bets against the prevailing market trends by buying assets that are either under-performing or depressed at that point in time. This is done with the belief that the herd mentality followed by investors on the Street will lead to mispricing of assets, which will pick up steam in the long run, creating opportunities for investors to generate superlative returns.Description: A contra fund is distinguished from other funds by its style of investing. A contra fund takes a contrarian view of an asset, when it either witnesses exuberant demand from investors or is shunned by them at a particular point in time due to short-term triggers. The asset’s poor performance or outperformance leads to distortion in valuations, which is what a contra fund seeks to capitalise on. The underlying assumption is that the asset will stabilise and come to its real value in the long term once the short-term concerns plaguing it either become irrelevant or are mitigated. The idea is to buy assets at a cost lower than its fundamental value in the long term. Investors must take note of the fact that contra funds may not perform in the short term because of the kind of assets they invest in. The contra fund may pick up stocks that are out of favour or invest in sectors that are witnessing a slump. A fund that seeks to capitalise on a commodities slump by picking up stocks in companies belonging to the sector can be called a contra fund. ING Contra, L&T Contra, SBI Magnum Contra, Kotak Contra, Tata Contra, UTI Contra and Religare Contra are some of the examples of contra funds in the Indian market."
28,0,Cost Of Carry,"Definition: Cost of carry can be defined simply as the net cost of holding a position. The most widely used model for pricing futures contracts, the term is used in capital markets to define the difference between the cost of a particular asset and the returns generated on it over a particular period. It can also be defined as the difference between the interest generated on a cash asset and the cost of funds to finance that instrument.	In the commodity market, it is the cost of holding an asset in physical form, including insurance payments. In the derivatives market, it includes interest expenses on margin accounts, which is the cost incurred on an underlying security or index until the expiry of the futures contract. The cost also includes economic costs, such as the opportunity costs associated with taking the initial position.Description: Theoretically, the price of a futures contract is the sum of the prevailing spot price and the cost of carry. (See formula) But the actual price of futures contract also depends on the demand and supply of the underlying stock.	Formula:	 	Futures price = Spot price + cost of carry	 	Or cost of carry = Futures price – spot price	BSE defines the cost of carry as the interest cost of a similar position in cash market and carried to maturity of the futures contract, less any dividend expected till the expiry of the contract.Example:	 	Suppose the spot price of scrip X is Rs 1,600 and the prevailing interest rate is 7 per cent per annum. Futures price of one-month contract would therefore be:	 	1,600 + 1,600*0.07*30/365 = Rs 1,600 + Rs 11.51 = 1,611.51	 	Here, Rs 11.51 is the cost of carry.	When making an informed investment decision, consideration must be given to all potential costs associated with taking a position. A longer position on margin attracts higher interest payment.	Buying of more futures as opposed to cash generally raises the cost of carry, as it is an annualised premium of the futures to cash. The higher the absolute price difference between futures and cash, higher is the cost of carry.	Meanwhile, the term is used to interpret market sentiment for a stock or index, as higher values of cost of carry along with the build-up of open interest indicates that traders are bullish and willing to pay more for holding futures. The opposite is true for falling cost of carry.	Sometimes, futures trade at a discount to the price of the underlying, which makes the cost of carry negative. This usually happens when the stock is expected to pay a dividend, or when traders execute a reverse-arbitrage strategy that involves buying in spot market and selling futures. This reflects bearish sentiment."
29,0,Cyclical Stock,"Definition: In the investing world, cyclical stocks are those whose fortunes swing as per the business cycle of an economy. A cyclical stock typically moves up or down depending on the upward or downward movement in the economy. These stocks are usually traded heavily as investors try to buy them at the low point of a business cycle and sell at the high point of the same cycle.Descriptions: Securities of discretionary companies are usually referred to as cyclical stocks, as consumers tend to buy the products of these companies in a booming economy, but choose to cut down on consumption during a recession or economic slowdown.Shares of car manufacturers, luxury goods makers, clothing stores, airlines and hotels can be termed as cyclical in nature, as these companies see a surge in sales when the economy is booming and are also the first to feel the pain when the economy slows down.Profits of these companies rise in a booming economy, as consumers have more disposable income to spend on such products as was the case in India during the period between 2004 and 2007. At the same time, their profits decline during a slowdown or recession as consumers cut down spending.There are various indicators based on which one can judge a cyclical stock. The first is the Beta value or systemic risk. Cyclicals tend to have high beta values, which are usually higher than 1. A beta of 1.5 means if the market falls 10 per cent, the stock is likely to fall 15 per cent.Secondly, cyclical stocks tend to have volatile earnings per share or EPS, as their earnings keep on fluctuating in relation to the sentiment in the economy. The third aspect is price-earnings ratio, which compares the price of a stock in relation to its EPS. Cyclicals generally tend to have low PE ratios, making them cheaper in comparison to defensive stocks."
30,0,Day Trader,"Definition: Day trader refers to the market operator who indulges in day trading. A day trader buys and subsequently sells financial instruments like stocks, currencies or futures and options within the same trading day, which means all the positions that he creates are closed on the same trading day. A successful day trader must know which stocks to trade in, when to enter a trade and when to exit it.Description: The main objective of a day trader is to take advantage of small price movements in highly-liquid stocks. The more volatile the market, the more favourable are the conditions for a day trader. A day trader must have good knowledge of the stocks, the tools used and also the right platform to trade. A day trader makes profit by differentiating between the bid price and ask price. Sensing an imminent movement in a particular share in either direction, a day trader would buy or sell it above or below the bid price or ask price. There are two kinds of day traders: those who trade individually and those who work with a financial institution. A day trader who works individually often manages other people’s money or uses own money, but the limited scope of resources often prevents him from competing with the day trader who works with a company. Day traders usually hold their securities for a single day and their trading style is very different from real-time investors. They close their positions at the end of each day. Due to the short-term nature of day trading, there is less risk involved in it as there’s no risk of something happening overnight to cause a big loss."
31,0,Dead Cat Bounce,"Definition: ‘Dead Cat Bounce’ is a market jargon for a situation where a security (read stock) or an index experiences a short-lived burst of upward movement in a largely downward trend. It is a temporary rally in the price of a security or an index after a major correction or downward trend.Description: The term is borrowed from a phrase, which says “even a dead cat will bounce if dropped from a height.” A widely-used term in the investing world, it is often very difficult for analysts and traders to predict a dead cat bounce.	In order to aid the explanation, let’s say there is a security named XYZ priced at Rs 10. In the past seven weeks, the security has been experiencing a major correction, which has taken the price to Rs 2-level. In the eighth week, the stock sees an upward movement, which takes it to Rs 3, but the following week it falls to Re 1. On hindsight, the jump in price in the eighth week will be termed as ‘dead cat bounce’.	It is a pricing pattern used by stock analysts to determine whether a spurt in the price of a stock after a major correction is a reversal of the downward trend or just a dead cat bounce. Dead cat bounces are, usually, observed in hindsight, as it’s very difficult for analysts and traders to figure them out from a simple trend reversal. More often than not, such a spurt can be caused due to bargain buying by traders and investors, who may mistake the bottom of the stock price.	The opportunity is usually beneficial for short-term traders, as it can allow them to make profits from the short rally. Investors may use the event to initiate short positions on the security."
32,0,Delisting,"Definition: Delisting involves removal of listed securities of a company from a stock exchange where it is traded on a permanent basis.Description: Delisting curbs the securities of the delisted company from being traded on the stock exchange. It can be done either on voluntary decision of the company or forcibly done by SEBI on account of some wrong doing by the company. There are certain norms which a company needs to follow while listing on the stock exchange.	In case the company fails to do so, then SEBI takes the action which generally leads to delisting of the company from the stock exchange.Also See: Listing, Voluntary Delisting, Compulsory Delisting, SEBI, Relisting"
33,0,Derivatives,"Definition: A derivative is a contract between two parties which derives its value/price from an underlying asset. The most common types of derivatives are futures, options, forwards and swaps.Description: It is a financial instrument which derives its value/price from the underlying assets. Originally, underlying corpus is first created which can consist of one security or a combination of different securities. The value of the underlying asset is bound to change as the value of the underlying assets keep changing continuously.	Generally stocks, bonds, currency, commodities and interest rates form the underlying asset.What are Derivatives? Watch video to know more..."
34,0,Dividend,"Definition: Dividend refers to a reward, cash or otherwise, that a company gives to its shareholders. Dividends can be issued in various forms, such as cash payment, stocks or any other form. A company’s dividend is decided by its board of directors and it requires the shareholders’ approval. However, it is not obligatory for a company to pay dividend. Dividend is usually a part of the profit that the company shares with its shareholders.Description: After paying its creditors, a company can use part or whole of the residual profits to reward its shareholders as dividends. However, when firms face cash shortage or when it needs cash for reinvestments, it can also skip paying dividends. When a company announces dividend, it also fixes a record date and all shareholders who are registered as of that date become eligible to get dividend payout in proportion to their shareholding. The company usually mails the cheques to shareholders within in a week or so. Stocks are normally bought or sold with dividend until two business days ahead of the record date and then they turn ex-dividend. A recent study found that dividend-paying firms in India fell from 24 per cent in 2001 to almost 16 per cent in 2009 before rising to 19 per cent in 2010.	In the US, some of the companies like Sun Microsystems, Cisco and Oracle do not pay dividends and reinvest their total profit in the business itself. Dividend payment usually does not affect the fundamental value of a company’s share price. Companies with high growth rate and at an early stage of their ventures rarely pay dividends as they prefer to reinvest most of their profit to help sustain the higher growth and expansion. On the other hand, established companies try to offer regular dividends to reward loyal investors."
35,0,Dividend Yield,"Definition: Dividend yield is the financial ratio that measures the quantum of cash dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the market value per share. It is computed by dividing the dividend per share by the market price per share and multiplying the result by 100. A company with a high dividend yield pays a substantial share of its profits in the form of dividends. Dividend yield of a company is always compared with the average of the industry to which the company belongs.Description: Companies distribute a portion of their profits as dividends, while retaining the remaining portion to reinvest in the business. Dividends are paid out to the shareholders of a company. Dividend yield measures the quantum of earnings by way of total dividends that investors make by investing in that company. It is normally expressed as a percentage. The formula for computing the dividend yield is Dividend Yield = Cash Dividend per share / Market Price per share * 100.	 	Suppose a company with a stock price of Rs 100 declares a dividend of Rs 10 per share. In that case, the dividend yield of the stock will be 10/100*100 = 10%. High dividend yield stocks are good investment options during volatile times, as these companies offer good payoff options. They are suitable for risk-averse investors. The caveat is, investors need to check the valuation as well as the dividend-paying track record of the company. Companies with high dividend yield normally do not keep a substantial portion of profits as retained earnings. Their stocks are called income stocks. This is in contrast to growth stocks, where the companies retain a major portion of the profit in the form of retained earnings and invest that to grow the business. Dividends in the hands of investors are tax-free and, hence, investing in high dividend yield stocks creates an efficient tax-saving asset. Investors also take recourse to dividend stripping for tax saving. In this process, investors buy stocks just before dividend is declared and sell them after the payout. By doing so, they earn tax-free dividends. Normally, the share price gets reduced after the dividend is paid out. By selling the share after the dividend payout, investors incur capital loss and then set off that against capital gains."
36,0,Earnings Per Share (eps),"Definition: Earnings per share or EPS is an important financial measure, which indicates the profitability of a company. It is calculated by dividing the company’s net income with its total number of outstanding shares. It is a tool that market participants use frequently to gauge the profitability of a company before buying its shares.Description: EPS is the portion of a company’s profit that is allocated to every individual share of the stock. It is a term that is of much importance to investors and people who trade in the stock market. The higher the earnings per share of a company, the better is its profitability. While calculating the EPS, it is advisable to use the weighted ratio, as the number of shares outstanding can change over time.	Earnings per share can be calculated in two ways:	1) Earnings per share: Net Income after Tax/Total Number of Outstanding Shares	2) Weighted earnings per share: (Net Income after Tax - Total Dividends)/Total Number of Outstanding Shares	A more diluted version of the ratio also includes convertible shares as well as warrants under outstanding shares. It is considered to be a more expanded version of the basic earnings per share ratio.	For an investor who is primarily interested in a steady source of income, the EPS ratio can tell him/her the room a company has for increasing its existing dividend. Although, EPS is very important and crucial tool for investors, it should not be looked at in isolation. EPS of a company should always be considered in relation to other companies in order to make a more informed and prudent investment decision."
37,0,Electronic Stock Exchange,"Definition: An electronic stock exchange refers to a stock bourse where the majority, if not all, trades take place through electronic trading platforms or portals. Electronic trading is considered more efficient, superfast and accurate and carries out multi-billion dollar worth of trades in equity markets the world over every day.	Today, most stock markets around the world are electronically-traded exchanges, where buyers and sellers meet on a virtually-created platform to exchange various kinds of financial securities such as stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and derivatives.Description: In the years before the information technology revolution, stock exchanges used to be a crying well of stock brokers and buyers. Even on the Bombay Stock Exchange, stocks used to be traded through the open outcry method in a pit, where brokers would shout the bid prices for a stock and the best one would win.	Among the very first electronic stock exchanges was Globex, which was conceived in 1987 and fully launched in 1992. Soon, competition followed from the Chicago Board of Trade’s Oak Trading System.	The first electronic trading platform in India was launched by the National Stock Exchange (NSE), which revolutionised stock trading in the country. The electronic screen-based trading proved more efficient and simpler to use for traders and investors.	 	Some of the key benefits of electronic stock exchanges include increased transparency in stock trading and higher liquidity, as companies are allowed to exchange shares from any part of the country. This facilitates higher competition and reduced transaction cost, helping investors earn more money and increase participation in the market."
38,0,Equity Dilution,"Definition: Equity dilution refers to the cut down in the stock holding of shareholders in relative terms of a particular company, usually a startup, whenever an offering for new shares is made whether through an IPO, FPO or private equity.Description: The valuation of a company increases whenever more money comes in as a form of investment through an external entity.	However, the total number of shares issued of that particular company increases while the number of shares held by the initial investors remain the same, thus their equity holdings in the company reduces in percentage terms. This reduction is termed as equity dilution.Also see: Debentures, Net Worth"
39,0,Equity Warrants,"Definition: Equity warrants are instruments that bestow upon the holder of the instrument the right to buy a particular stock at a predetermined price within a stipulated time frame. However, to gain this right, the buyer of such warrants usually needs to make an upfront payment to the warrants issuer. On exercise of such warrants, fresh shares are issued by the issuer company.	Warrants are also issued by the way of preferential allotment to promoters, institutional investors, and other strategic investors. This allows such entities to increase their stake if the performance of the underlying business (and thus the stock) is on a high growth path.Description: According to Indian regulations, in the case of preferential allotments, the buyer of the warrants needs to pay 25 per cent of the price upfront. This payment is to be adjusted against the final payment that needs to be paid in case the warrants are exercised.	In case the warrants are not exercised, the entire upfront payment is forfeited. Also, the pre-determined price of warrant conversion in such cases cannot be less than either:	1) The average of the weekly high and low of the closing prices of the related shares quoted on the stock exchange during the six months preceding the relevant date	OR	2) The average of the weekly highs and lows of the closing prices of the related shares quoted on a stock exchange during the two weeks preceding the relevant date	The rule for minimum pricing in case of preferential allotment of warrants is enforced in order to protect the interest of minority shareholders. In the absence of such a rule, a promoter/strategic investor may increase the stake in the target company via warrants in a bear market at throwaway prices.	Also, since warrants are not equity shares, they do not carry any dividend or voting rights. It is only after warrants are converted into equity shares does the investor gain dividend and voting rights.	Suppose a stock had an LTP of Rs 100 on April 1, 2015, and the average of its weekly high and low closing prices of the previous six months is Rs 120 while the average of the weekly highs and lows of the closing prices of preceding two weeks is Rs 140.	In such a case, if any preferential allotment of warrants is to be made to a particular set of investors, the minimum price of such warrants shall be Rs 140. And the investor(s) will have to pay 25 per cent of this price (i.e. Rs 35 in case the exercise price is Rs 140) upfront to the company immediately on issuance of the warrants.	By September 30, 2017, investors need to pay up a minimum of Rs 105 (75 per cent of Rs 140) to the company for allotment of shares. If the investor doesn’t pay the rest of the amount by this date, s/he will not be allotted any shares and would lose the paid amount too."
40,0,Esop,"Definition: An employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) is a type of employee benefit plan which is intended to encourage employees to acquire stocks or ownership in the company.Description: Under these plans, the employer gives certain stocks of the company to the employee for negligible or less costs which remain in the ESOP trust fund, until the options vests and the employee exercises them or the employee leaves/retires from the company or institution.	These plans are aimed at improving the performance of the company and increasing the value of the shares by involving stock holders, who are also the employees, in the working of the company. The ESOPs help in minimizing problems related to incentives.Also See: Employee Benefit Plan, Employee Stock Options, Employees Stock Plans, Return On Investment, Provident Fund, Gratuity, Social Security Benefits, Insurance Schemes"
41,0,European Options,"Definition: It is an option which gives buyer or seller a chance to exercise the contract only at the maturity date.Description: Unlike American options, there is no freedom of an early exercise of the European options. Financial instruments (bonds, stocks, derivative etc.) that are traded directly between the parties (over the counter) are mainly European options. In India, all options that are being introduced are European options. Expiration of these options happens on the last Thursday of every month.Also See: Option, American Option, Over the Counter, Call Option, Put Option"
42,0,Exercise Date,"Definition: Exercise date refers to the date on which a trader decides to exercise an option (Call/Put) on an exchange or with a brokerage whether bought or written/sold where ‘exercise’ means making use of the actual right specified in the contract. It can be on or before the expiry date based on the option style (American or European). The right to decide the exercise date before the expiry date, in case of American style options, lies with the holder or owner of an option.	In European style option, the exercise date is the same as expiry date. In certain places, if the trader doesn’t specify exercising instructions, it goes for compulsory exercising by the regulatory authority and that day is termed as the exercise date for that option.Description: In the Indian context, exercise date doesn’t make much sense as options are cash settled. So, the holder of an option doesn’t have the power of exercising the actual right of an option to buy or sell an instrument on or before the expiry date. Majority of option contracts are not exercised on or before the expiry date because options are allowed to be bought/sold on an exchange before the expiry date and can expire worthless or closed by the holder/other party.	The exercise date can also be set for the last day for which a trader may notify the exchange of his objective to exercise a Call or Put option. The exercise date is important mainly in option trading. The owner of an option contract has the right to exercise his/her contract on a particular date, and therefore, requires that the financial transaction is in line with the contract specifications, which will be carried out between the two parties. If the holder decides to buy or sell the underlying instrument on the exercise date, then he or she will exercise the option at the same strike price as per the contract.Source : Optionsatoz"
43,0,Expiry Date,"Definition: Expiry date is the date, as the name suggests, on which a particular contract (usually a derivative contract) expires. Every derivative contract, which is based on an underlying security such as a stock, commodity, or a currency, has an expiry date, though the underlying security usually does not have any expiry date.	A derivative contract based on an underlying security exists only for a specified period, which ends on its expiry date.Description: On the expiry date, the derivative contract is finally settled between the buyer and seller. The settlement happens in either of the following ways:	a. Physical delivery: In case of physical delivery of the underlying security under a particular contract (usually that’s the case with commodities), the seller of the contract delivers the quantity to the buyer, who pays the full price for it.	b. Cash settlement: It means settlement of the difference between the spot price and the derivative price through the exchange of money and not the underlying security itself. Currently, equity derivatives are settled by cash in India.	In case of Indian stock exchanges, the expiry date is the last working Thursday of the month when the contract expires. The example below should help clarify the same.	Suppose there are three future contracts on the Nifty50 index, namely:	1. Near month contract expiring on Jan 28, 2016	2. Next month contract expiring on Feb 25, 2016	3. Far month contract expiring on Mar 31, 2016	A buyer can buy any of these contracts till the end of the working day on Jan 28, 2016, which is a Thursday. On Jan 28, 2016, the first contract, i.e. the near-term contract, will be settled in cash."
44,0,Fiis,"	Definition: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are those institutional investors which invest in the assets belonging to a different country other than that where these organizations are based.	Description: Foreign institutional investors play a very important role in any economy. These are the big companies such as investment banks, mutual funds etc, who invest considerable amount of money in the Indian markets. With the buying of securities by these big players, markets trend to move upward and vice-versa. They exert strong influence on the total inflows coming into the economy.	Market regulator SEBI has over 1450 foreign institutional investors registered with it. The FIIs are considered as both a trigger and a catalyst for the market performance by encouraging investment from all classes of investors which further leads to growth in financial market trends under a self-organized system.

45,0,Flash Crash,"Definition: Flash crash is nothing but a sudden crash (fall) in the stock prices.Description: Such a crash might take place due to manual as well as algorithmic errors. Taking a recent example, the NSE Nifty lost 900 points (over 15%) in a matter of seconds on October 5, 2012. In this case, though the stock exchange was forced to pause trading for a while, the NSE claimed it was a human error rather than an algorithmic one which caused the crash.Also See: NSE Flash Crash, 2010 Flash Crash"
46,0,Floating Stock,"Definition: Floating stock can be defined as the total number of shares of a stock that are available for trading in an open market. It can be calculated by subtracting the sum of closely-held shares (shares that are not publicly traded) plus restricted stock (non- transferable stock of a company) from the company’s total outstanding shares.Description: Floating stock represents the total number of outstanding stock/shares that are open to public for investment. The number can also be used to calculate the market value/goodwill of a company because it reflects the public interest or investor interest to invest in that company. Outstanding shares of a company can be calculated by subtracting the company’s closely-held shares and restricted shares from the company’s total shares. Closely-held shares are those which are owned by shareholders directly associated with the company or management. These shares can’t be traded publically like common shares. Restricted stock is also known as restricted securities. It describes the non-transferable stock of a company. Example of 'Floating Stock'.	Suppose a company called XYZ has 50,000 outstanding shares with stakeholders as follows: 1) Institutions 5,000, 2) ABC Company 10,000, 3) Management and insiders 15,000, 4) Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) 2,000. In this case, the floating stock would 18,000 [50,000 – (5,000+10,000+15,000+2,000)].	The above number is very important for investors, as it reflects the total available shares that are traded openly by public. Shares that are traded by investors do not affect the floating stock, because this does not reflect any change in the restricted and closely-held shares."
47,0,Fpo,"Definition: FPO (Follow on Public Offer) is a process by which a company, which is already listed on an exchange, issues new shares to the investors or the existing shareholders, usually the promoters. FPO is used by companies to diversify their equity base.Description: A company uses FPO after it has gone through the process of an IPO and decides to make more of its shares available to the public or to raise capital to expand or pay off debt.Also See: IPO, Underwriter, Equity, Stock, Debt"
48,0,Front Running,"Definition: Brokers have access to information related to the orders of investors in advance. If they illegally use this information to trade in securities to obtain profits on their personal account, such a practice is called front running.Description: Brokers have access to information about crucial transactions even before they have taken place, which can be misused for personal benefit in trading. For example, if a broker is aware of an order for purchase of a large number of shares of XYZ Company and he also buys some shares of the same company for his personal account, this is a case of front running.	Experts say that complaints of such practices on part of commission agents and brokers keep arising in the commodity market and should be highly discouraged.Also See: Insider Trading, Circular Trading, Flash Trading, Stock Brokers, Brokerage, Misappropriation Theory, Public Information, Securities and Exchange Board of India"
49,0,Future Delivery,Definition: Future delivery refers to the quantity of financial instrument or commodities contracted to be delivered at a future date.Description: The actual delivery of contracted financial instrument or commodity on the future date is termed as future delivery.For example: Two traders -- A & B -- agree to buy/sell 5 bushels of wheat at a pre-determined price. Here 5 bushels of wheat is the future delivery.
50,0,Futures Contract,"Definition: A futures contract is a contract between two parties where both parties agree to buy and sell a particular asset of specific quantity and at a predetermined price, at a specified date in future.Description: The payment and delivery of the asset is made on the future date termed as delivery date. The buyer in the futures contract is known as to hold a long position or simply long. The seller in the futures contracts is said to be having short position or simply short.	The underlying asset in a futures contract could be commodities, stocks, currencies, interest rates and bond. The futures contract is held at a recognized stock exchange. The exchange acts as mediator and facilitator between the parties. In the beginning both the parties are required by the exchange to put beforehand a nominal account as part of contract known as the margin.	Since the futures prices are bound to change every day, the differences in prices are settled on daily basis from the margin. If the margin is used up, the contractee has to replenish the margin back in the account. This process is called marking to market. Thus, on the day of delivery it is only the spot price that is used to decide the difference as all other differences had been previously settled.	Futures can be used to hedge against risk or speculate the prices."
51,0,Guts Options (gut Spread),"Definition: A Guts Options Strategy consists of simultaneously buying or selling of Call and Put options that are in-the-money* for the same security and same expiry date. The strike prices of both the options are chosen just next to the at-the-money (ATM) Calls and Puts, i.e. higher strike price than ATM Put for Put Option and lower strike price than ATM Call for Call option.	When both Call and Put options are bought, it is called a Long Gut Spread, and when both Call and Put options are sold, it is called a Short Gut Spread. This is a costly option, as in-the-money (ITM) options are considered, which are generally expensive.Description: This is a neutral option strategy, where if the price moves on either side, profit on one option will reduce the loss on the other option. Gut options are further divided into two categories:	a) Long Guts Option/Spread: It involves going long on an in-the-money Call option at a lower strike price and a Put option at a higher strike price at the same time for the same security and expiry date. This strategy is opted when the trader is not sure of the direction but anticipates major price movement in the security, which increases the value of one of the options chosen and raises the chances of unlimited profit with limited risk. The Long Guts strategy is somewhat like a Long Strangle with the only difference being that out-of-the-money options are considered in the latter case. Also the cost involved in Long Guts is less than that needed in a Long Strangle. It’s a debit spread strategy as the trader pays a premium on both the options at start of the trade.Example: A trader buys ITM Call option and Put option of RIL for the January series at strike prices Rs 1,040 and Rs 1,080 at premiums of Rs 43.35 and Rs 38.40, where the underlying price is Rs 1,060. The total cost at the start of trade would be (Rs 43.35 + Rs 38.40) = Rs 81.75 (Premiums paid for buying both the options)	Case 1: Security price moves upwards to Rs 1,200 on expiry day, so the Rs 1080 Put option expires worthless and Rs 1,040 Call option gets executed.	Profit/Loss = ((Rs 1,200-Rs 1,040)-Rs 81.75) = Rs 78.25 further commission and exchange taxes will be deducted to get the actual profit/loss	Case 2: If the price didn’t change and remains at Rs 1,060, then both the options will be executed	Profit/Loss = ((Rs 1,060-Rs 1,040) + (Rs 1,080-Rs 1,060)-Rs 81.75) = (-) Rs 41.75 further commission and exchange taxes will be deducted to get actual profit/loss	Case 3: Security price moves downwards to Rs 1,000 on the expiry day. So call option at Rs 1,040 expires worthless and Put option at Rs 1,080 gets executed.	Profit/Loss = ((Rs 1,080-Rs 1,000)-Rs 81.75) = (-) Rs 1.75 further commission and exchange taxes will be deducted to get actual profit/loss	Case 4: Trader exits the strategy by selling both options in market at premium of Rs 50 (Call) and Rs 45 (Put)	Profit/Loss = ((Rs 50+Rs 45)-Rs 81.75) = Rs 3.25 further commission and exchange taxes will be deducted to get actual profit/loss	In this strategy, the maximum profit, loss and breakeven points are:	— Maximum Profit = This will be achieved when the price of the security is less than the strike price of the long Put and greater than strike price of the long Call	— Maximum Loss = When the price of the security is in between the strike prices of Call and Put, which is the maximum loss point	— Breakeven points are:	Upper = Long Call Strike Price + Premium Paid	Lower = Long Put Strike Price – Premium Paid	b) Short Guts Option/Spread: It involves selling in-the-money Call and Put options at the same time for the same security and expiry date, where the strike prices of both the options are at equidistance from the underlying price. A trader opts for this strategy when he expects less volatility. It’s a credit spread strategy, as the trader receives the premium on both the options at the start of the trade, which is limited profit but at the cost of a very high risk of losing money if the strategy fails as there are no caps on price movements.	The short guts strategy is somewhat like a short strangle, with the only difference being that out-of-the-money options are considered in the latter case.	Example: A trader sells Tata Motors ITM Call option and Put option of January series at strike prices Rs 340 and Rs 360 at premiums of Rs 20.50 and Rs 14.35, where the underlying price is Rs 350. Now (20.50+14.35) = 34.85 is the premium received for selling both the options.	Case 1: If the security price moves upwards to Rs 380 on the expiry day, the Put option at Rs 360 expires worthless and the Call option at Rs 340 gets executed.	Profit/Loss = ((Rs 340-Rs 380)+Rs 34.85) = (-) Rs 5.15 further commission and exchange taxes will be deducted to get actual profit/loss (Case of Naked options)	Case 2: Price doesn’t change and remains at Rs 350. Then both the options will be executed	Profit/Loss = ((Rs 340- Rs 350) + (Rs 360- Rs 350)+ Rs 34.85) = Rs 34.85 further commission and exchange taxes will be deducted to get actual profit/loss	Case 3: The security price moves downwards to Rs 300 on the expiry day. So the Call option at Rs 340 expires worthless and the Put option at Rs 360 gets executed	Profit/Loss = ((Rs 300-Rs 360)+Rs 34.85) = (-) Rs 25.15 further commission and exchange taxes will be deducted to get actual profit/loss	Case 4: The trader exits the strategy by buying both options in the market at a premium of Rs 15 (Call) and Rs 15 (Put)	Profit/Loss = (Rs 34.85-(Rs 15+Rs 15)) = Rs 4.85 further commission and exchange taxes will be deducted to get actual profit/loss	In this strategy, the maximum profit, loss and breakeven points are:	— Maximum Profit = This will be achieved when the price is between both the strike prices	— Maximum Loss = When the security price is more than the Call strike price or less than the Put strike price	— Breakeven points are:	Upper = Long Call Strike Price + Premium Earned	Lower = Long Put Strike Price – Premium Earned	*In-the-money (ITM) > ITM Call when the underlying price is more than the strike price	> ITM Put when the underlying price is less than the strike price"
52,0,Head And Shoulders,"Definition: Head and shoulders is one of the many popular chart patterns widely used by investors and traders to determine market trend. Such a formation usually occurs on the technical chart of a stock/index, when the same is in the process of reversing an ongoing trend. This pattern occurs on the chart when the stock/index price hits its peak and declines thereafter. Then the price rises above the previous peak and declines. And finally, it rises again, but not as high as the second peak and declines from that point. Here the middle peak forms the head and the peaks on either sides create the shoulders.Description: Head and shoulder is a ‘reversal pattern’ in which the price trend either changes from bearish to bullish or bullish to bearish and takes a shape that looks like a human head with shoulders on either side as shown in the line chart below.	Volume is a very important factor to look at when one studies this pattern. Volume is highest and often expands on the left shoulder as the uptrend continues and more and more investors want to get in, whereas it is lowest on the right shoulder as investors sense a trend reversal. This low volume is often considered a strong sign of reversal. In the head portion of the pattern, volume lies somewhere between that on the left shoulder and right shoulder.	The head and shoulders pattern has another variation, called head and shoulders inverse, which looks like just the reverse of the head and shoulders pattern. Head and shoulders bottom or inverse has three low peak price points created by a falling stock/index."
53,0,Hedge Fund,"Definition: Hedge fund is a private investment partnership and funds pool that uses varied and complex proprietary strategies and invests or trades in complex products, including listed and unlisted derivatives.	Put simply, a hedge fund is a pool of money that takes both short and long positions, buys and sells equities, initiates arbitrage, and trades bonds, currencies, convertible securities, commodities and derivative products to generate returns at reduced risk. As the name suggests, the fund tries to hedge risks to investor’s capital against market volatility by employing alternative investment approaches.Description: Hedge fund investors typically include high net worth individuals (HNIs) and families, endowments and pension funds, insurance companies, and banks. These funds work either as private investment partnerships or offshore investment corporations. They are not required to be registered with the securities markets regulator and are not subject to the reporting requirements, including periodic disclosure of NAVs.	There are many strategies a hedge fund may use to generate returns. One such strategy is global macros, where the fund takes long and short positions in large financial markets based on the views influenced by economic trends. Then there are funds that work on market-neutral strategies. Here, the goal of the fund manager is to minimise market risks by investing in long/short equity funds, convertible bonds, arbitrage funds, and fixed income products.	Another type includes event-driven funds that invest in stocks to take advantage of price movements generated by corporate events. Merger arbitrage funds and distressed asset funds fall into this category.	As of June 30, 2014, there were 158 alternative investment funds (pooled-in investment vehicles for private equity, real estate, and hedge funds). Some examples of hedge funds include names like Munoth Hedge Fund, Forefront Alternative Investment Trust, Quant First Alternative Investment Trust and IIFL Opportunities Fund. There are others such as Singlar India Opportunities Trust, Motilal Oswal’s offshore hedge fund and India Zen Fund.	The minimum ticket size for investors putting money in these hedge funds is Rs 1 crore. According to Eurekahedge India Hedge Fund Index, which tracks hedge funds in India, the category generated 5.07 per cent return in 2015 compared to 38.84 per cent logged in 2014."
54,0,Impact Cost,"Definition: Impact cost is the cost that a buyer or seller of stocks incurs while executing a transaction due to the prevailing liquidity condition on the counter. In other words, it represents the cost of executing a transaction of a given security, with a specific predefined order size, at any given point in time.Description: It is a realistic measure of liquidity of the stock or security and is deemed to be closer to the true cost of execution faced by a trader in comparison to the bid-ask spread (difference between the best buy and the best sell orders). It is the percentage markup observed while buying or selling a desired quantity of shares with reference to its ideal price.	The ideal price can be illustrated by an example.	Suppose a buyer wants to purchase 3,000 shares of, say, ABC. If the best buy order for 1,000 shares is placed at Rs 237 and the best sell order for 1,500 shares is placed at Rs 239, the ideal price for the deal should be:	(239+237)/2 = Rs 238	At this price, one can expect the buyer to ideally get the desired quantity of ABC shares.	But suppose that the buyer was able to buy 3,000 ABC shares at an average cost of Rs 239.67 (see the above table)  	Average cost:  [(1500x 239) + (1000 x 240) + (500 x 241)]/3000 	Or (3,58,500+ 2,40,000+ 1,20,500)/3000 = 239.83	The impact cost, therefore, would be 0.70 per cent. To find the impact cost, the formula is:	(Actual cost - ideal cost)/ideal cost*100                             (#)	In our example, the ideal price is Rs 238, but the average acquisition price for that buyer is Rs 239.67.	By formula (#), the impact cost should thus be:  	(239.67 - 238)/239.67*100 = 0.70	This is a cost that the buyers incur due to lack of market liquidity. The importance of impact cost can be judged from the fact that it is one of the criteria to select a stock for inclusion in the NSE’s benchmark index Nifty50.	For a stock to qualify for possible inclusion into Nifty50, it has to have traded at an average impact cost of 0.50 per cent or less during the last six months for 90 per cent of the observations for a basket size of Rs 2 crore.	It must be note that impact cost does vary for different transaction sizes. It is dynamic in nature and depends on the outstanding orders. Lastly, a penal impact cost is applicable if a stock is not sufficiently liquid."
55,0,Implied Volatility,"Definition: In the world of option trading, implied volatility signals the expected gyrations in an options contract over its lifetime. Investors and traders use it to determine option pricing. Many experts in derivatives trading look at this indicator as a more important tool than time value of an option for pricing a contract.	Implied volatility alerts an investor of the possibility of uneven changes in the price of the underlying security, as it is dependent on demand and supply of a particular option contract as well as expectation of the direction of share price.Description: Implied volatility helps investors gauge future market volatility. It has a positive correlation with the expectation of stock price and is one of the six parameters used to determine the price of an option. If investors believe the price of a stock will rise in the future, then implied volatility will rise, whereas if they expect the price to fall, then implied volatility will decline.	How does implied volatility affect the price of an option? Lower implied volatility means the price of an option will fall. The time value of an option, talked about earlier, hence becomes cheaper or expensive depending on the fall or rise in implied volatility.	The formula for the calculation of Implied Volatility is as follow:	s˜2pT---v.C/S	wherein,	 	s= Implied volatility	 	T= Duration of the option contract	 	C= Call price of the option contract	 	S= Strike price of the contract	The term is of great importance to traders and investors, as the success of their trade can be greatly increased depending on whether they are on the right side of the volatility. Short-dated options have lower sensitivity to implied volatility whereas long-dated options have higher sensitivity to it as the time value is priced into such option in a higher quantity."
56,0,Index Option,"Definition: All the options that have an index as underlying are known as Index Options. The two most basic and popular index options are Call Option and Put Option. Further, they may be American Options or European Options.	A Call Option gives the buyer a right to buy a specified quantity of an underlying index at a pre-decided price. For this privilege, the buyer of the Call Option pays an upfront premium to the seller or writer. A Put Option gives the buyer the right to sell a specified quantity of an underlying index at a pre-decided price; for this privilege the buyer of the Put Option pays an upfront premium to the Put Option seller or writer.	An American Option may be exercised anytime before the expiry of the contract whereas a European Option can be exercised only on the day of expiry.Description: Consider an index, say the Nifty50 index of NSE. Now all Call Options and Put Options being traded on the Nifty50 are together called as Nifty50 Index Options or just Nifty50 Options.	On the link below you can find the most actively traded Nifty50 options on the NSE:	 	http://www.nseindia.com/live_market/dynaContent/live_watch/derivative_stock_watch.htm	Refer to the table in the above link. The 1st column on the page states that the option type is “Index Options” with “Nifty50” as the underlying having 29 October 2015 as expiry date. The next column displays the “Strike Price” of the options. The next four columns display the Open, High, Low, Previous Close and Last Price for the trading day. After that “Volume Contracts” specify the number of individual contracts traded on that day.	The next column “Turnover (lacs)” represents the notional turnover of the options, i.e. Sum of (strike price of each contract traded today X No of underlying asset in each contract). The column “Premium Turnover” is the sum of premium paid on all the contracts traded through the day. The last column “Underlying Value”, as the name suggests, displays the value of the underlying asset, in this case, spot Nifty50 index."
57,0,Insider Trading,"Definition: Insider trading is defined as a malpractice wherein trade of a company's securities is undertaken by people who by virtue of their work have access to the otherwise non public information which can be crucial for making investment decisions.Description: When insiders, e.g. key employees or executives who have access to the strategic information about the company, use the same for trading in the company's stocks or securities, it is called insider trading and is highly discouraged by the Securities and Exchange Board of India to promote fair trading in the market for the benefit of the common investor.	Insider trading is an unfair practice, wherein the other stock holders are at a great disadvantage due to lack of important insider non-public information. However, in certain cases if the information has been made public, in a way that all concerned investors have access to it, that will not be a case of illegal insider trading.Also See: Front Running, Securities, Insider, Insider Information, Material Insider Information, Misappropriation Theory, Public Information, Securities and Exchange Board of India"
58,0,Ipo,"Definition: Initial public offering is the process by which a private company can go public by sale of its stocks to general public. It could be a new, young company or an old company which decides to be listed on an exchange and hence goes public.	Companies can raise equity capital with the help of an IPO by issuing new shares to the public or the existing shareholders can sell their shares to the public without raising any fresh capital.Description: A company offering its shares to the public is not obliged to repay the capital to public investors.	The company which offers its shares, known as an 'issuer', does so with the help of investment banks. After IPO, the company's shares are traded in an open market. Those shares can be further sold by investors through secondary market trading."
59,0,Iron Butterfly Option,"Definition: The Iron Butterfly Option strategy, also called Ironfly, is a combination of four different kinds of option contracts, which together make one bull Call spread and bear Put spread.	Together these spreads make a range to earn some profit with limited loss. Ironfly belongs to the ‘wingspread’ options strategy group, which is defined as a limited risk strategy with potential to earn limited profit. The strategy is considered when the future outlook of a security is neutral, and there is low volatility in the market.	The user of the strategy combines four option contracts with three different strike prices of the same expiry date, wherein he buys/sells higher strike price Put/Call options along with lower strike price Call/Put options, both of which are out-of-the-money, and also buys/sells another set of at-the-money Call/Put options at the middle strike price.	Thus, an iron butterfly option strategy involves the following:	1)Buying and selling of Call/Put options (Bull Call spread & Bear Put spread combination)	2)All options have the same underlying asset with same expiry date/expiration	3)It involves combining four option contracts	4)It involves three different strike prices; higher, middle and lower, where the difference between the middle strike price and the lower strike price or the upper strike price is the same. Two contracts have the same strike price.Description: In Iron Butterfly, there is a higher probability of earning profit because the way it is constructed by combining Calls and Puts or bear Put and bull Call spread, it becomes different from a classic Butterfly option strategy, where the strategy involves a combination of either bull spreads or bear spreads. The strategy gives best result and maximum profit when it is near to expiry and at-the-money, which means the underlying price is equal to the mid-strike price out of all strike prices. In this strategy, a butterfly-like image is formed where the Call and Put options of the mid-strike price form the ‘body’ and Call and Put options at higher and lower strike prices form the ‘wings’.Example: The Tata Motors stock is trading at Rs 378.10. Now a trader forms a long iron butterfly strategy by buying one lot of December expiry Put option at a lower strike price of Rs 360 and one lot of same expiry Call option at a higher strike price at Rs 400 at values of Rs 1.25 (360 Put) and Rs 1.10 (400 Call) and then sells one lot each in Call and Put options at same the strike price of Rs 380 for Rs 5.65 (380 Call) & Rs 7.50 (380 Put).	Now, the trader’s profit at the entry of the trade would be Rs 10.80 = (Rs 5.65+Rs 7.50-(Rs 1.25+Rs 1.10)),	If the strategy fails, the maximum loss will be (Rs 400-Rs 380-Rs 10.80) = Rs 9.20 plus commissions	If Tata Motors trades at the same level of Rs 380 on expiry date in December end, then the Call option at the higher strike price will expire worthless as out-of-the-money (Strike price is more than the trading price), while the Put option at the lower strike price will again expire worthless (strike price is less than trading price) and there are two sold at-the-money Call and Put options, which expired worthless. So on expiry, the payout of this strategy will be Rs 10.80 minus the trading costs, which will be the actual profit/loss.	But if the trader decides to exit the strategy before expiry, when Tata Motors is trading around Rs 375 in cash market, and the options are trading at Rs 1.5 (360 Put), Rs 0.9 (400 Call), Rs 7.05 (380 Call) and Rs 6.5 (380 Put), the payout will be:	Call Option (Rs 400) – (Rs 0.9- Rs 1.10) = (-)Rs 0.2 (Loss)	Put Option (Rs 360) – (Rs 1.5- Rs 1.25) = Rs 0.25 (Profit)	Call Option (Rs 380) – (Rs 5.65- Rs 7.05) = (-)Rs 1.40 (Loss)	Put Option (Rs 380) – (Rs 7.50- Rs 6.50) = Rs 1 (Profit)	Net Profit & Loss = (-) Rs 0.35 plus commission and exchange taxes so in all loss	There are various risks to this strategy, which include:	1)High implied volatility or prices are very volatile	2)If cash price moves outside the strike price range, that can affect the delta of the strategy	3)It has a long expiry time, as sentiments in the market can change	4)Out-of-the-money expiry in case of all Calls or Puts or delivery on the expiry date can work in reverse way for this strategy	5)Higher trading costs, commissions and taxesLong Iron Butterfly: This means buying one Call option at a higher strike price and Put option at a lower strike price, and simultaneously selling Call and Put options at a strike price near to cash price or the middle strike price of the same expiry and underlying asset (index, commodity, currency, interest rates). 	The maximum a trader may lose is the (Long Call option strike price – Short put option strike price – net premium received + taxes paid), when the cash price is beyond the range of high and low strike prices on expiry. It will generate the maximum profit when the cash price is equal to middle strike price on the expiry day. The breakeven points of this strategy are:	Upper Breakeven Point = Strike price short call option (Strike Price + Premium received)	Lower Breakeven Point = Strike Price short put option (Strike Price - Premium received)	Short Iron Butterfly: This means selling one Call option at a higher strike price and one Put option at a lower strike price and, simultaneously, buying Call and Put options at a strike price near to cash price of the same expiry and underlying asset (index, commodity, currency, interest rates). A trader may lose maximum of premium paid plus taxes, which will occur when the cash price trades at same level. It will earn maximum profit when the cash price is beyond the range of lower and higher strike prices on the expiry day (Profit = (Short Call or Long Put) Strike Price – (Short Put or Long Call) Strike Price - Premium Paid – Taxes).	The breakeven points of this strategy are:	Upper Breakeven Point = Higher strike price long call/put option (Strike Price - Premium paid)	Lower Breakeven Point = Lower strike price long call/put option (Strike Price + Premium paid)Source YouTube Channel: Option Alpha"
60,0,Iron Condor,"Definition: Iron Condor is a non-directional option strategy, whereby an option trader combines a Bull Put spread and Bear Call spread to generate profit. In this strategy, there is a high probability of limited gain. An option trader resorts to this strategy if he believes that the market is going to be rangebound. The maximum profit in an Iron Condor strategy is equal to the net premium received adjusted for commissions. The maximum loss occurs when the price of the underlying security is higher than the strike price of the Long Call or when the price of the underlying security is less than the strike price of the Long Put. Description: Iron Condor options involve the use of both Call and Put options to generate profit for the option trader. In a Call option trade, the two counter-parties involved are Call Option writer and Call Option buyer. The two parties have counter-views on the direction of the security price. The Call Option buyer believes that the price of the underlying security is going to rise while the Call Option writer believes that the price of the underlying security is going to fall.	Buying an option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to acquire the security at a fixed price, called the Strike Price, within a certain date called the expiry date. If the Strike Price is less than the current market price of the underlying security, then the option is said to have an intrinsic value. This means that the option buyer will find it worthy to exercise his right. This scenario is also called in the money.Scenario	1.      Trade: Buy a Call	2.      Option buyer’s outlook for the underlying security: Bullish	3.      Risk: Limited	4.      Reward: Unlimited	5.      Break-even point: Strike price plus premium  	In a Put Option trade, the counterparties remain the same as Call Option trade. But their views about the direction of the price of the underlying security change. The Put Option buyer believes that the price of the security is going to fall while the Put Option writer believes that the price of the underlying security is going to rise. If the strike price is more than the current market price of the underlying, then the Put Option is said to be in the money. This means it has some intrinsic value which makes it worthy for the Put Option buyer to exercise his right.          Scenario	1.      Trade: Buy a Put	2.      Option buyer’s outlook for the underlying security: Bearish	3.      Risk: Limited	4.      Reward: Limited	5.      Break-even point: Strike price minus premium   	Iron Condor option strategy is a limited risk-limited reward option trading strategy and can be seen as a combination of Bull Put spread and Bear Call spread. In a Bull Put spread, the option trader sells a Put option and at the same time buys a Put option at a lower strike price but with the same expiry. In this strategy, both risk and reward is limited. Increase in volatility typically hurts the option trader.	In a Bear Call Spread, the option trader sells a Call option and at the same time buys another Call option with a higher strike but with the same expiry. In this strategy, both risk and reward is limited.		 	In an Iron Condor option strategy, an option trader sells a Call option while at the same time buys another Call with a higher strike price. Simultaneously, he buys a Put option and at the same time buys another Put option at a lower strike price, but both expiring at the same time. Thus it’s a combination of both Bull Put spread and Bear Call spread. 	In this strategy, the option trader believes that the market is neutral or rangebound. Both risk and reward in this strategy is limited. The maximum profit is attained when the stock price is between the strike price of the Short Put and Short Call. Time decay helps the options trader whereas an increase in volatility hurts position. Two break-even points are created in an Iron Condor option strategy.	1.      Strike price in Short Call plus net premium received	2.      Strike price in Short Put minus net premium received 	The payoff diagram for a Condor options strategy is shown below	Let us take a scenario  	Current market price of stock X: Rs 150	An option trader executes the following trades	1.      Writes a Feb 2016 Call option at strike price Rs 160 and receives a premium of Rs 20	2.      Buys a Feb 2016 Call option at strike price Rs 165 and earns a premium of Rs 20	3.      Sells a Feb 2016 Put option at strike price Rs 140 and receives a premium of Rs 40	4.      Buys a Feb 2016 Put option at strike price Rs 130 and earns a premium of Rs 30	The net premium received from the transaction	= 20-20+40-30 = 10	Assuming the stock trades at Rs 150 till the expiry of the option term, the maximum profit that the trader earns is equal to the premium received from the transaction. In this case, the maximum profit will be equal to Rs 10.	Now assuming that the stock price fell to Rs 130 before expiry, the option trader will benefit from the trade. 	The following are the trading scenarios:		So in the above strategy, there is only one situation where the option is in-the-money or in other words, has an intrinsic value.  "
61,0,Lot Size,"Definition: Lot size refers to the quantity of an item ordered for delivery on a specific date or manufactured in a single production run. In other words, lot size basically refers to the total quantity of a product ordered for manufacturing. In financial markets, lot size is a measure or quantity increment suitable to or précised by the party which is offering to buy or sell it. A simple example of lot size is: when we buy a pack of six chocolates, it refers to buying a single lot of chocolate.Description: In the stock market, lot size refers to the number of shares you buy in one transaction. In options trading, lot size represents the total number of contracts contained in one derivative security. The theory of lot size allows financial markets to regulate price quotes. It basically refers to the size of the trade that you make in the financial market. With the regulation of prices, investors are always aware of exactly how many units they are buying of an individual contract and can easily assess what is the price they are paying for each unit.If no lot size is defined, there will be no standardisation of price and valuing and trading of option contracts would be bulky and consuming. A smaller lot of production is an important part of many lean manufacturing strategies. Inventory and development directly affect the lot size. There are other factors too, which are less evident but equally essential.A small lot size causes reduction in variability in the system and ensures smooth production. It enhances quality, simplifies scheduling, reduces inventory, and encourages continuous improvement. In the derivatives market, the lot size of futures and options contracts is determined by the stock exchange from time to time. The lot size of various F&O contracts for a given underlying is always the same."
62,0,Management Buy Out(mbo),"Definition: Management buyout (MBO) is a type of acquisition where a group led by people in the current management of a company buy out majority of the shares from existing shareholders and take control of the company.	For example, company ABC is a listed entity where the management has a 25 per cent holding while the remaining portion is floated among public shareholders. In the case of an MBO, the current management will purchase enough shares outstanding with the public so that it can end up holding at least 51 per cent of the stock.Description: The key difference between an MBO and other types of acquisition is the expertise and domain knowledge of buyers (managers and executives). Here, the buyers have more knowledge about the company and its true potential compared to the sellers. That way, the seller would be at a disadvantage as the buyer may intentionally undervalue the company and buy stocks through unfair means at a lower price.	An MBO can happen in a publicly listed or a private sector company. When it happens in a publicly listed company, it becomes private. Some of the gains from the company going private are reduced listing and registration costs and less regulatory and disclosure overhead. Other benefits include improved efficiency of managers as they own the company and accordingly they have better incentives to work harder. They take decisions that can benefit the company in the long run.	At times, the managers may not be wealthy enough to buy majority of the shares. Therefore, additional funds may have to be raised through debt or with the help private equity funds. So, a large part of the transaction becomes debt financed while the remaining shares are held by private investors. This debt load on the firm makes its management leaner and more efficient."
63,0,Margin Trading,"Definition: In the stock market, margin trading refers to the process whereby individual investors buy more stocks than they can afford to. Margin trading also refers to intraday trading in India and various stock brokers provide this service. Margin trading involves buying and selling of securities in one single session.	Over time, various brokerages have relaxed the approach on time duration. The process requires an investor to speculate or guess the stock movement in a particular session. Margin trading is an easy way of making a fast buck. With the advent of electronic stock exchanges, the once specialised field is now accessible to even small traders.Description: The process is fairly simple. A margin account provides you the resources to buy more quantities of a stock than you can afford at any point of time. For this purpose, the broker would lend the money to buy shares and keep them as collateral.	In order to trade with a margin account, you are first required to place a request with your broker to open a margin account. This requires you to pay a certain amount of money upfront to the broker in cash, which is called the minimum margin. This would help the broker recover some money by squaring off, should the trader lose the bet and fail to recuperate the money.	Once the account is open, you are required to pay an initial margin (IM), which is a certain percentage of the total traded value pre-determined by the broker.	Before you start trading, you need to remember three important steps. First, you need to maintain the minimum margin (MM) through the session, because on a very volatile day, the stock price can fall more than one had anticipated.	For example, if a Tata Steel stock priced at Rs 400 falls 4.25 per cent and the IM and MM are 8 per cent and 4 per cent of the total value of the shares bought, respectively, then the trade-off 8%-4.25%=3.75% will be less than the MM. In this case, you will either have to give more money to the broker to maintain the margin or the trade will get squared off automatically by the broker.	Secondly, you need to square off your position at the end of every trading session. If you have bought shares, you have to sell them. And if you have sold shares, you will have to buy them at the end of the session.	Thirdly, convert it into a delivery order after trade, in which case you will have to keep the cash ready to buy all the shares you had bought during the session and to pay the broker’s fees and additional charges.	If even one of these steps is missed, the broker will automatically square off the position in the market."
64,0,Moving Average Convergence Divergence,"Definition: Moving average convergence divergence, or MACD, is one of the most popular tools or momentum indicators used in technical analysis. This was developed by Gerald Appel towards the end of 1970s. This indicator is used to understand the momentum and its directional strength by calculating the difference between two time period intervals, which are a collection of historical time series. In MACD, ‘moving averages’ of two separate time intervals are used (most often done on historical closing prices of a security), and a momentum oscillator line is arrived at by taking the difference of the two moving averages, which is also denoted as ‘divergence’. The simple rule for taking the two moving average is that one should be of shorter time period and the other longer time period. Generally, exponential moving averages (EMA) are considered for this purpose.Description: The main points for an MACD indicator are:a) Time period or interval – which the user can define. Commonly used time periods are:Short-term intervals – 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15-day intervals, but 9-day and 12-day durations are more popularLong-term intervals – 21, 26, 30, 45, 50, 90, 200-day intervals; 26-day & 50-day intervals are more popularb) Momentum oscillator line or divergence or MACD line – which can be simple plotting of ‘divergence’ or difference between two interval moving averagesc) Signal Line – which is exponential moving average of divergence data e.g. 9-day EMAd) Normally a combination of 12-day and 26-day EMA of prices and 9-day EMA of divergence data is used, but these values can be changed depending on the trading goal and factorse) The above data is then plotted on a chart, where the X- axis is for time and Y-axis is price, to get MACD line, signal line and histogram for the difference between the MACD and signal line, which is shown below the X-axisExample:Take the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages of closing prices of a security. To calculate the exponential moving average of closing prices, you need to take the weighted calculation of simple moving averages, where the weighing multiplier needs to be calculated. For calculation, refer to the exponential moving average concept. Then both the EMA data difference will be taken and used to draw an MACD line for the said duration and plotted as a line graph. This area is below the time axis and is divided by the 0 axis or called as centreline to show negative and positive. Then nine-day EMA will be calculated for MACD data in the same manner as above, which is called the ‘signal line’. Then a bar graph or histogram is drawn in the same area where the bar length shows movement variation in the MACD line and the signal line at single point. Here is a screenshot of the same, when plotted on the graph.Source – http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/technical-chartsThe MACD and signal line move above and below the zero axis or centreline to signal a trend such as overbought and oversold conditions. When the EMA points are close to each other, that is called convergence, and when they are apart, it is called divergence. The shorter the moving average, the more the reaction of the MACD line. There are three ways to interpret the MACD:Here are some of the indications of an MACD and what they mean:-1) Signal Line crossovers: Signal line is EMA of the MACD line. So it trails the average line and helps spot the turns in the MACD. When the MACD crosses turn above the signal line, it shows bullishness and is called a bullish crossover. If it turns below the signal line, that’s called a bearish crossover.2) Centreline crossovers: When the MACD crosses turn above the zero line, it shows bullishness and is called a bullish centreline crossover. If it turns below the zero line, it’s a bearish centreline crossover. A positive crossover happens when the shorter EMA of the underlying security moves above the longer EMA.3) Divergence: This shows a point where the MACD deviates and does not follow price action. When the price touches a new low, but the MACD does not confirm the same by making a new low, that’s considered a bullish divergence. Whereas in a bearish divergence, the price touches a new high, but the MACD does not make a new high on its own. The divergence points can show subtle shifts in a security.Some other important points:· The MACD indicator should be used when there is a proper trend. It doesn’t work in a rangebound market.· Long bars in a histogram show divergence while short bars show convergence of the moving averages· MACD has a positive momentum when a shorter EMA moves above the longer one, but when it moves below the longer EMA, that signals negative momentum.· When the MACD rises significantly and short EMA pulls from the longer one, that signals an overbought condition· There can be fake signals from the MACD too. For instance, there can be a bullish signal line crossover but a steep decline in price of a security.Similarly, there can be a negative crossover but a sharp rise in the price of the underlying. So an event needs to be looked at for a longer duration for confirmation.Source YouTube channel: Specialist Share Education"
65,0,Multibagger,"Definition: Stocks that give returns that are several times their costs are called multibaggers. These are essentially stocks that are undervalued and have strong fundamentals, thus presenting themselves as great investment options. Multibagger stock companies are strong on corporate governance and have businesses that are scalable within a short span of time.Description: A stock that doubles its price is called two-bagger while if the price grows 10-times, it would be called a 10-bagger. Thus, multibaggers are stocks whose prices have risen multiple times their initial investment values.	How to identify multibagger stocks?	1. Debt level of the company should be within reasonable limits: There are no defined levels per se for debt, as it will vary from industry to industry. However, as a ballpark measure, debt should not be more than 30 per cent of the equity value.	2. Check on previous quarter performance: Keep a check on the company’s revenue multiples on a quarter-on-quarter basis. If the multiples are low but the company is performing at the operational level, then that can be a hint that the company has significant upside potential.	3. Sources of earnings: Along with the revenue numbers, check the sources from which the company is making money. Is the primary revenue segment set to grow at the macro level? Are the operations of the company easily scalable? If yes, then the stock may have the potential to be a multibagger.	4. Earnings and price multiples: Calculate the trailing 12-month EPS and revenue to arrive at the current PE and price /sales ratios. If the PE level is growing faster than the stock price, then its chances of being a multibagger are bright.	5. Check out business model/capex/ structural/management changes: Be on the lookout for any major changes in the quarterly results/annual reports that could have significant impact on the company’s operations."
66,0,Naked Options,"Definition: Naked options are a kind of option trading strategy, where the trader – who is a writer/seller of Call/Put option – doesn’t have enough cover/protection/hedge for the position against adverse movement in the price of the underlying. Because of this property, such options are called ‘naked’, as they have no or insufficient cover against risk. When the seller of an option contract has no power to execute the basic right of the contract, it can expose him to the underlying risk associated with option trading. More so, if the trader doesn’t own the security in physical form. If the price of an asset does not move in the direction that the trader anticipates, the seller of the option will have to buy or sell the security as per the option contract if the owner exercises the right of the option. On the other hand, if options are cash-settled, then the value of the underlying will be paid to the other party, which can open a window for unlimited losses.Description: Naked option trading can be explained further depending on whether the option writer sells a Call option or Put option.	a) Naked Call/Uncovered Call/Short Call Option: Selling a Call option means the seller of a Call option has the obligation to sell assets but no right to opt out if the buyer of the option exercises the right to buy (traders go for short Call when they anticipate prices to go down in future). If the seller of the Call option doesn’t hold the asset in physical form, that is called a Naked Call option. In this case, there is a high risk of losing money.	Example: A trader sells a Call option at strike price $50 at a premium of $1 but does not hold the underlying stock, which makes the option naked. Now, if the stock price rises to $80 on expiry date, the trader has to buy it from the market at current price as the option is in-the-money and he has to sell it to the option buyer because he is most likely to exercise the option. Thus, the trader incurs a loss of ($80-$50) = $30 on the transaction, as he will be selling it at $50. It would work in favor of the trader if the price falls to $40, in which case he will earn a premium $1, which is the profit as the option would expire worthless because it would become out-of-the-money.	In this strategy, the maximum profit, loss and breakeven points would be,	— Maximum Profit = Option Premium Received – Paid Costs of Trade (This will be achieved when the price of the security is less than the strike price of the short Naked Call Option)	 	— Maximum Loss = Price of Security – Strike Price of Short Call - Option Premium + Paid costs on Trade (Loss potential is unlimited which occurs when the current price exceeds strike price)	 	— Breakeven = Short Call Strike Price + Premium Earned		Naked Call option can be disastrous if the price rises significantly. That’s why brokers do not allow using this strategy if physical assets are not there or the trade is not done with stop loss orders. When trading with this strategy, a trader has sold the right for something which he/she does not own in physical form. Naked Call option is a bearish strategy where the only objective is to earn option premium and exit.	b) Naked Put/Uncovered Put/Short Put: When a Put option is sold, that means the seller of the Put option has the obligation to buy assets, but no right to opt out if the buyer of the Put option exercises his right to sell (Traders go for short Put when they anticipate prices to go up in future). If the seller of the Put option has no intention of buying the physical asset or forgets to offset the option trade in the market before expiry, that is termed as naked Put option and in this case there is risk of losing money.	Example: A trader sells a Put option at strike price $40 for a premium of $2 and the seller has no intention of buying the underlying stock. So this option is naked. If the stock price falls to $20 on the expiry date, the trader has to buy the shares from the buyer of the Put option at the strike price, as the option is in-the-money and the buyer would exercise his option of selling shares. So, the trader would incur a loss of (40-20) = $20 on this transaction, as he will be buying shares at strike price $40 instead of current price $20 from the market. It would work in favour of the trader it the price increases to $60. Then he will earn a premium $2, which is his profit as the Put option would turn out-of-the-money and expire worthless.	In this strategy, the maximum profit, loss and breakeven points would be:	— Maximum Profit = Option Premium Received – Paid Costs on Trade (This will be achieved when the price of security is more than strike price of short naked Put Option)	 	— Maximum Loss = Strike Price of Short Put - Price of Security - Option Premium + Paid costs on Trade (Loss potential is unlimited which occurs when Price falls significantly)	 	— Breakeven = Short Put Strike Price - Premium Earned		Naked Put option can be disastrous if the prices drop significantly. That’s why brokers do not allow using this strategy until a trader has excessive cash margin deposited. Naked Put option is a bullish strategy where the only high point is to earn option premium and exit.	These are some important elements while trading with naked options:	1) Timing of entering a Naked option strategy. When the outlook for price movement is not certain, it can work against the strategy.	2) Stop loss orders if the fundamentals of the strategy reverse	3) Don’t trade in far month options i.e. expiry should be near one	4) Take protection as cash in hand for Put and physical security for Call options if waiting till expiry, otherwise exit before expirySource: TheOptionsAcademy's channel"
67,0,Net Worth,"Definition: Net worth is the difference between the asset and the liability of an individual or a company.Description: A high net worth relates to good financial strength and ultimately good credit rating of an individual or a company. Similarly a low or negative net worth will relate to a weaker financial strength and a lower credit rating, thus directly affecting the individual's or the company's ability to raise funds from the market.Also See: Valuation, Equity Dilution"
68,0,Non Convertible Debentures,"Definition: Debentures are long-term financial instruments which acknowledge a debt obligation towards the issuer. Some debentures have a feature of convertibility into shares after a certain point of time at the discretion of the owner. The debentures which can't be converted into shares or equities are called non-convertible debentures (or NCDs).Description: Non-convertible debentures are used as tools to raise long-term funds by companies through a public issue. To compensate for this drawback of non-convertibility, lenders are usually given a higher rate of return compared to convertible debentures.	Besides, NCDs offer various other benefits to the owner such as high liquidity through stock market listing, tax exemptions at source and safety since they can be issued by companies which have a good credit rating as specified in the norms laid down by RBI for the issue of NCDs. In India, usually these have to be issued of a minimum maturity of 90 days.Also See: Debentures, Convertible Debentures, Fixed Deposits Shares, Debt, Public Issue, Convertible Preference Shares, Non-Convertible Preference Shares, Bonds, Secured Non- Convertible Debentures, Secured Redeemable Non-Convertible DebenturesNCDs: How do they work?"
69,0,Offer For Sale (ofs),"Definition: Offer for sale (OFS) is a simpler method of share sale through the exchange platform for listed companies. The mechanism was first introduced by India’s securities market regulator Sebi, in 2012, to make it easier for promoters of publicly-traded companies to cut their holdings and comply with the minimum public shareholding norms by June 2013. The method was largely adopted by listed companies, both state-run and private, to adhere to the Sebi order. Later, the government started using this route to divest its shareholding in public sector enterprises.Description: Unlike a follow-on public offering (FPO), where companies can raise funds by issuing fresh shares or promoters can sell their existing stakes, or both, the OFS mechanism is used only when existing shares are put on the block. Only promoters or shareholders holding more than 10 per cent of the share capital in a company can come up with such an issue.	The mechanism is available to 200 top companies in terms of market capitalisation. In an OFS, a minimum of 25 per cent of the shares offered, are reserved for mutual funds (MFs) and insurance companies. At any point, no single bidder other than these two institutional categories is allocated more than 25 per cent of the size of the offering.	A minimum of 10 per cent of the offer size is reserved for retail investors. A seller can offer a discount to retail investors either on the bid price or on the final allotment price. The OFS window is open only for a single day. It is mandatory for the company to inform the stock exchanges two banking days prior to the OFS about its intention.	This has a key advantage over follow-on public offer (FPO), which stays open for three to 10 days, and takes considerable time, as it requires filing of draft papers and obtaining necessary approvals from Sebi.	In OFS, the entire retail bid amount is backed by 100 per cent margins in the form of cash and cash-equivalent. The process is quick and any excess fund, due to non-allotment or partial allotment, is refunded to the trading member on the same day, after 6 pm.	Bids backed by 100 per cent margins are allowed to be modified anytime during the OFS hours. Nonetheless, those with zero per cent margin can only be modified upwards, for revision in price and quantity. No cancellation is permitted in such bids.	Bids below the floor price are rejected. The allocation remains subject to final price discovery. An FPO, on the other hand, defines a price band within which bids are placed.	The floor price is generally set at a discount to the prevailing price. But sometimes things go overboard. Take the example of MMTC. In June 2013, the OFS was offered at a steep discount of 72 per cent, thanks to low free-float shares (and hence low volumes) and premium valuations on lack of efficient price discovery mechanism. The stock crashed and now trades way below its pre-OFS price."
70,0,Open,"Definition: It is the price at which the financial security opens in the market when trading begins. It may or may not be different from the previous day's closing price. The security may open at a higher price than the closing price due to excess demand of the security.Description: Suppose a financial security closes at Rs 565.20 on Monday and opens at Rs 565.20 on Tuesday. In this case the open price is the same as the closing price of the previous day.	On the other hand, if the security opens at Rs 567.30 on Tuesday, then open price is said to be different from Monday. Thus, the price in the beginning of trading sessions is called open price or simply open."
71,0,Open Interest,"Definition: Open interest is the total number of outstanding contracts that are held by market participants at the end of each day. Open interest measures the total level of activity into the futures market.Description: If both parties to the trade are initiating a new position (one new buyer and one new seller), open interest will increase by one contract. If both traders are closing an existing or old position (one old buyer and one old seller), open interest will decline by one contract. If one old trader passes off his position to a new trader (one old buyer sells to one new buyer), open interest will not change.	Increasing open interest means that new money is flowing into the marketplace. The result will be that the present trend (up, down or sideways) will continue. Declining open interest means that the market is liquidating and implies that the prevailing price trend is coming to an end. Therefore, open interest provides a lead indication of an impending change of trend.	To determine the total open interest for any given market, we only need to know the totals from one side or the other, buyers or sellers, and not the sum of both."
72,0,Optionally Convertible Debentures,"Definition: Optionally convertible debentures are debt securities which allow an issuer to raise capital and in return the issuer pays interest to the investor till the maturity.Description: The investor of such debentures has a right to convert the debt into equities of the issuing company at a price which is normally decided at the time of the issue.See Also: Debentures, Debt Funds"
73,0,Penny Stock,"Definition: Penny stocks are those that trade at a very low price, have very low market capitalisation, are mostly illiquid, and are usually listed on a smaller exchange. Penny stocks in the Indian stock market can have prices below Rs 10. These stocks are very speculative in nature and are considered highly risky because of lack of liquidity, smaller number of shareholders, large bid-ask spreads and limited disclosure of information.Description: In western markets, shares that trade below $1 are usually called penny stocks. But this basket also includes stocks priced under $5. Penny stocks are highly risky, but some of them also have the potential of turning a small investment into a fortune. For example, if you own 50,000 shares of a penny stock priced at $1, even a $1 rise in the share price can give you $50,000 in a single day. This is not possible in the case of a large stock, because it would require large capital to buy such a large volume of shares. There are a lot of downsides to penny stocks too, as they are prone to price manipulations, sudden delisting and regulatory scrutiny. One can move the stock by buying thousands of shares and create a spike without leaving any cue for the average investor to know whether the spike in price is genuine or manipulated. Also, penny stocks are more prone to scams, as they are often not regulated by a national-level stock exchange. Because of all these risks, stock exchanges put these types of stocks in a different category, called as trade-to-trade basket. In this category, no intraday share trading is allowed. Transactions have to be compulsorily settled on gross basis, which means you must deliver the shares on the same day if you have sold them or take delivery if you have bought them."
74,0,Preference Shares,"Definition: Preference shares allow an investor to own a stake at the issuing company with a condition that whenever the company decides to pay dividends, the holders of the preference shares will be the first to be paid.Description: Dividend payment of the preference shareholders is fixed and if somehow company liquefies, the owners of the preference shares will be the first one to get their money back after the company has paid back its debt.	There are different kind of preference shares available, such as cumulative and non cumulative preference shares, redeemable and non-redeemable preference shares, convertible and non-convertible preference shares, participating and non participating preference shares.Watch the video to learn more about Preference sharesSee Also: Bonds, Equity"
75,0,Preferential Allotment,"Definition: Preferential Allotment is the process by which allotment of securities/shares is done on a preferential basis to a select group of investors.Description: For raising funds, it is not always preferable or feasible for a company to issue securities to the public at large as it is time consuming as well as an expensive option. In such situations, the securities can be offered to a comparatively smaller group of individuals, such as the directors or the existing shareholders. This entire process is known as preferential allotment.Also See: Rights Issue, Allotment of Shares, SEBI Guidelines"
76,0,Proprietary Desk,"Definition: For learning about proprietary desk, the concept of proprietary trading needs to be first understood.	When, for the purpose of earning profits, a firm trades in stocks, commodities, bonds or in any other financial instrument with the firm's own money instead of the customer's money, it is termed as proprietary trading. The bank/company staff taking part in this activity of proprietary trading is often referred to as proprietary desk.Also See: Proprietary Trading, Index Arbitrage, Statistical Arbitrage"
77,0,Put-call Ratio,"Definition: Put-call ratio (PCR) is an indicator commonly used to determine the mood of the options market. Being a contrarian indicator, the ratio looks at options buildup, helps traders understand whether a recent fall or rise in the market is excessive and if the time has come to take a contrarian call. The ratio is calculated either on the basis of options trading volumes or on the basis of options contracts on a given day or period.	One way to calculate PCR is by dividing the number of open interest in a Put contract by the number of open interest in Call option at the same strike price and expiry date on any given day.	PCR (OI) = Put open interest on a given day/Call open interest on the same day	It can also be calculated by dividing put trading volume by call trading volume on a given day.	PCR (Volume) = Put trading volume/call trading volume	PCR for marketwide positions can also be calculated by taking total number of OI for all open Call options and for all open Put options in a given series.Description: A PCR ratio below 1 suggests that traders are buying more Call options than Put options. It signals that most market participants are betting on a likely bullish trend going forward. For contrarians, it is a signal to go against the wind.	On the flip side, if the ratio is higher than 1, it suggests traders are buying more Puts than Calls. Unlike Call options, Put options are not initiated just for directional call. They are bought also to hedge against any decline in the market.	The market sentiment is deemed excessively bearish when the PCR is at a relatively high level. But for contrarian investors, it suggests that the market may soon bottom out. On the other hand, when the ratio falls to a relatively low level, it is deemed excessively bullish. For contrarians, it would suggest a market top is in the making.	The PCR can be calculated for indices, individual stocks and for the derivative segment as a whole.	For example, suppose Nifty50 Put option at strike price 8,000 for December expiry saw a volume of 5,609 contracts on a day. Suppose further that Call volume on that day at the same strike price and same expiry stood at 88,220.	In this case, the PCR would be	5,609/88,220 = 0.06	Now suppose the Put open interest for the same expiry and strike price stands at 4,310,600 and Call open interest stands at 6,816,250.	The PCR in this case would be	4310600/6816250 =0.63 (See table above)	If the ratio is high in a falling market, it reflects how bearish the sentiment is. But a rise in the ratio in a rising market is considered a bullish signal."
78,0,Put Option,"Definition: Put option is a derivative contract between two parties. The buyer of the put option earns a right (it is not an obligation) to exercise his option to sell a particular asset to the put option seller for a stipulated period of time.Description: Once the buyer of put exercises his option (before the expiration date), the seller of put has no other choice than to purchase the asset at the strike price at which it was originally agreed. The buyer of put expects the value of asset to decrease so that he can purchase more quantity at lower price."
79,0,Qip,"Definition: QIP or Qualified Institutional Placement is largely a fund raising tool for the listed companies.Description: QIP is a process which was introduced by SEBI so as to enable the listed companies to raise finance through the issue of securities to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs).	Earlier, since raising finance in the domestic market involved a lot of complications, Indian companies used to raise funds from the overseas markets. So to prevent this, SEBI introduced this process so as to make the raising of funds easier in the domestic market.Also See: QIB, Preferential Allotment, American Depositary Receipts (ADR)"
80,0,Record Date,"Definition: The issuing company fixes a particular date when the investor must own shares in order to be eligible to participate in corporate events like receiving dividend, bonus shares etc. This is called record date.	By this date, the company identifies its shareholders and sends them dividends, bonus shares or notice for AGMs etc., as the case may be.Also See: Stock Split, Equity, Bonus Ratio, Ex-Bonus Date"
81,0,Relative Strength Index,"DEFINITION: Relative Strength Index (acronym RSI) is one of the most extensively used momentum oscillators in the realm of technical analysis of stocks. It was introduced by Welles Wilder in June 1978 and its computation is explained in detail in his book New Concepts in Technical Trading System. Momentum oscillator measures the velocity and magnitude of price movements of a security. RSI compares the magnitude of average gains and average losses of a security for drawing inferences about its strength and weakness over a predetermined time period.DESCRIPTION: Relative Strength is computed using the formulaRSI = 100 – (100/1+RS)RS (Relative Strength) = Average of X days up closes / Average of X days down closesWilder used the 14 day RSI, which is still the most commonly used RSI. However, an analyst is free to decide the number of days for computing the same.For example, during a 14-day trading period assume that a security has generated positive returns on 9 days and negative returns on 5 days. In this case, the Relative Strength Index is calculated as follows1. Calculate the absolute gain in each of the 9 up days. Add the absolute gain of each day and divide by 14. This will give the figure of average up closes.2. Calculate the absolute loss in each of the 5 days. Add the absolute loss of each day and divide by 14. This will give the figure of average down closes.3. Dividing the average up closes or gains by the average down closes or losses gives us the Relative Strength.4. The figure is further normalised using the above formula so as to ensure that it lies between 0 and 100.For computing the next RSI, the following steps are followed1. For calculating the next average gains, multiply the previous average gains by 13 and add today’s gains if any and divide the result by 14. In our previous example, we will multiply the average absolute gains of 9 days and add today’s absolute gain (if any) and divide the result by 14.2. For calculating the next average losses, multiply the previous average losses by 13 and add today’s loss if any and divide the result by 14. In our example, we will multiply the average absolute losses of 5 days and add today’s absolute loss (if any) and divide by 14.3. The next step involves dividing the average gains by the average losses for getting the figure of Relative Strength.4. Finally, the RSI is found using the formula RSI = 100 – (100/1+RS)The following inferences can be drawn from Relative Strength Index1. Overbought and Oversold levels: RSI gives an indication of the impending reversals or reaction in price of a security. RSI moves in the range of 0 and 100. So an RSI of 0 means that the stock price has fallen in all of the 14 trading days. Similarly, an RSI of 100 means that the stock price has risen in all of the 14 trading days. In technical analysis, an RSI of above 70 is considered an overbought area while an RSI of less than 30 is considered as an oversold area. RSI can be used as a leading indicator as it normally tops and bottoms ahead of the market, thereby indicating an imminent correction in the price of a security. It is pertinent to note that the levels of 70 and 30 needs to be adjusted according to the inherent volatility of the security in question.2. Failure Swings: This is also called support and resistance penetrations or breakouts. Failure swings are indications of impending market reversals.Bearish failure swing In this chart, the RSI touches the 70 mark, the threshold of overbought zone then falls to 60. This is called the fail point. Post that, it moves again but rises less than the previous high of 70, thereby, creating a failure swing. It then falls below the fail point there creating a bearish failure swing. It acts as a signal for the trader to go for a short position in the security.Bullish failure swing In this chart, the RSI touches the 30 mark, the threshold of oversold zone and then rises to 40, the fail point. It then falls again but the fall is lower than the previous value of 30. Moreover, the RSI crosses the fail point to rise even higher thereby creating a bullish failure swing. It acts as a signal for a trader to go for a long position in the security.1. Divergence: Divergence results when the price of a security and the RSI behave differently. If the security price is decreasing or flat but RSI is increasing, it’s a sign of divergence. Similarly, when the security price is increasing or flat by RSI is falling, it’s a sign of divergence. It is a strong indication of an imminent market correction.2. Support and Resistance: In some situations, the RSI exhibits support and resistance levels with more clarity than the security price itself.The 14-day RSI of stock prices of Reliance Power in NSE. The overbought level set at over 70 and oversold level set at below 30. Source: http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/technical-chartsAccording to Wilder, the RSI used together with bar chart can provide pivotal inputs to an analyst for drawing inferences from a chart."
82,0,Required Rate Of Return,"Definition: Required Rate of return is the minimum acceptable return on investment sought by individuals or companies considering an investment opportunity.Description: Investors across the world use the required rate of return to calculate the minimum return they would accept on an investment, after taking into consideration all available options. When calculating the required rate of return, investors look at overall market returns, risk-free rate of return, volatility of the stock and overall project cost. The required rate of return drives the type of investments that can be made. For instance, someone requiring a higher rate of return would necessarily have to look at riskier investments. Finance professionals routinely calculate the required rate of return for purchasing new equipment, new product rollouts and potential mergers. For example: an investor who can earn 10 per cent every year by investing in US Bonds, would set a required rate of return of 12 per cent for a riskier investment before considering it.	Formula for Required Rate of Return Required Rate of Return = Risk Free Rate + Risk Co-efficient (Expected Return - Risk free return)"
83,0,Return Of Capital,"Definition: Return on Capital Employed or RoCE essentially measures the earnings as a proportion of debt+equity required by a business to continue normal operations. In the long run, this ratio should be higher than the investments made through debt and shareholders’ equity. Otherwise diminishing returns shall render the business unsustainable. This is a better measure of financial health of a company than return on equity or RoE, because it takes into account the contribution of debt while showing the company’s return.Description: R.O.C.E. = (Earnings from operations - interest and liabilities) / (Shareholders equity + debt)	Suppose ABC Corp had a net operating profit from operations as Rs 10,000,00. It reported in the balance sheet equity worth Rs 10,000,00 and liabilities worth Rs 2,500,00. ROCE= 10,000,00 / (10,000,00+2,500,00) = 0.8.	This means for every rupee invested in ABC Corp, the firm generates Re 0.8. From this angle, ABC Corp does not look like a financially-healthy organisation. RoCE is measured on an annual basis and plotted as a year-on-year trend line to see any noticeable change that might be occurring in the performance of the company. RoCE also has a few drawbacks. First, it tends to compare the current earnings with the book value of assets. So an organisation with depreciated assets will have more RoCE than a new organisation, even if they generate similar revenue using the same capital machinery. Profits can often be distorted using accounting policies or due to any other short-term influences. Also, for firms that do not disclose their performances to public, the RoCE data cannot be calculated accurately. Yet, using RoCE as a performance metric is considered far more useful, especially when it is used to compare a company's returns with peers operating in the same sector."
84,0,Return On Equity,"Definition: The Return On Equity ratio essentially measures the rate of return that the owners of common stock of a company receive on their shareholdings. Return on equity signifies how good the company is in generating returns on the investment it received from its shareholders.Description: Mathematically, Return on Equity = Net Income or Profits/Shareholder’s Equity.	The denominator is essentially the difference of a company’s assets and liabilities. It is the amount left over if an organisation decides to settle its liabilities at a given time.	So if a firm has an ROE of say 1, it means Re 1 of common shareholding generates a net income of Re 1. This metric is especially important from an investor’s perspective, as he/she uses it to judge how efficiently the firm will be able to use his/her investment to generate additional revenues.	Investors generally prefer firms with higher ROEs. However this can be used as a benchmark to pick stocks within the same sector only. Across sectors, profit and income levels vary significantly. Even within the same sector, the ROE levels may vary if a company chooses to give dividends and not keep the profit generated as idle cash.	Suppose, company XYZ has generated a profit Rs 1,00,000 and has about 1,000 shares with stockholders at a value of Rs 50 each. The board decides to issue dividend worth Rs 10,000 to the shareholders.	ROE = (1,00,000-10,000) / (1,000*50) = 1.8	This would mean that for every rupee invested in XYZ corporation, investors would generate Rs 1.8. In general terms, this looks like a high value. This can imply that XYZ was started recently and is in its fast growth stage."
85,0,Risk Reversal Options,"Definition: The quickest strategy in material trading is to sell a Call and buy a Put option with the same maturity. This strategy protects an investor from unfavourable downward price movements. However, the upside is also limited in case of upward movements. The Puts bought are generally of lower strike prices whereas the Calls sold have higher strike prices.Description: Risk reversal is done for two reasons – delta hedging or options skew. Delta hedging is primarily done to protect your asset from unfavourable downward price movements. An investor will buy a Put option to protect the downside. However, to finance the purchase of the Put option, the investor also has to sell a Call option. The selling of the Call option, thus, limits the potential upside in case of any upward movement.	For example, a manufacturing organisation known as ABC purchased a Rs 100 June Put option and sold a Rs 130 June Call option at same Put and Call options, which means the premium of Put and Call are equal. Under this scheme, ABC is guarded against all price hikes and downfalls (price fluctuation) in June below Rs 100 but the profit from any price rise will also have a maximum limit of Rs 130.	Options skewing involves quoting of out-of-the-money Calls and Puts. Instead of quoting the prices, dealers quote their implied volatility levels. The greater the demand for a contract, the higher will be the price and also the volatility. Positive reversal will imply the volatility of Calls is greater than that of the Puts and, thus, it would indicate a bullish trend and vice versa.	A check that the trader has to place is what sort of implied volatility levels are suited for Calls and Puts. For example 25 per cent volatility levels may be alright for Calls but may not work out for Puts."
86,0,Securities Based Lending,"Definition: Security-based lending is the practice of raising a loan by offering your existing investments in stocks/mutual funds/ETFs as collaterals. The loan can then be used for making purchases like real estate or personal items like cars. The only thing that this loan cannot be used for is making further security purchases or using the same for depositing of margin.Description: In order to raise cash for making a purchase, holders of securities can sell their investments, pay taxes on their gains and use the remaining as proceeds for making the purchase. By offering securities as mortgages, investors can continue with their investment strategies.	Also, at the same time, benefit from the low rate of interest that such loans carry. However, due to the inherent volatility in the nature of stocks/mutual funds, the risk of forced liquidation tends to be very high for these loans. The same shall be understood better with the example given below.	An investor has stocks worth Rs 1,00,000. Typically SBL allows him/her to borrow about 50-60 per cent of the market value of the underlying asset (This value can be less for penny stocks and higher for investment in bonds). So, the investor gets a loan of Rs 50,000 to purchase.	The lender or brokerage house also requires the investor to maintain a certain minimum level of equity in his/her account. The typical value for the same is around 30 per cent. The balance amount left in the account after making the purchase with the loan amount raised is Rs 50,000. So, this is fine right now (50%>30% required). This gets complicated when the market value of the stocks fall by about 20 per cent or more. The investor would then be required to add more cash to the account or add more stock."
87,0,Settlement Date,"Definition: Settlement date is the day on which a trade or a derivative contract must be settled by transferring the actual ownership of a security to the buyer, against necessary payment for the same. After a trade order is executed, it generally takes one to three days to settle it depending on the type of security bought. The settlement day excludes Saturdays, Sundays, bank, and exchange holidays.Description: Whenever a security is bought or sold, two key dates are involved: the transaction date or trade date and the settlement date.	A transaction date represents the date on which a transaction occurs whereas the settlement date is the day on which the transaction is finalised, that is, the ownership of the security is transferred to the buyer. Here it’s important to understand that the settlement does not happen on the same day the transaction happened, as it takes time to actually deliver the security and transfer payment for the same.	For example, suppose you placed an online trade order on Monday, June 8, and it was executed on the same day. So, Monday, June 8, becomes your trading date. Then the settlement date will be Thursday, June 11, three days after the trade date and represented as T+3, where T is the trade date. The settlement period depends on the security type and the country. For example in the US, the settlement period for stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is T+3 and for mutual funds (MFs) it’s T+1 i.e. one market day after trade date."
88,0,Share Turnover,"Definitions: Share turnover is a measure of liquidity, which signifies the relative ease with which an investor can easily convert a share into cash. It can help understand how easily a shareholder can find a buyer or seller for that asset in the open market. Share turnover is calculated by dividing the total number of shares traded over a particular period by the number of shares outstanding during that period. A high share turnover indicates that it is easier for investors to buy or sell the shares of that company in the open market.Descriptions: Share turnover helps you decide whether to purchase/sell the shares of a particular company over time. In simple terms, it compares the average number of shares of a company with the total number of shares that can be traded over a particular period. To calculate a company’s share turnover ratio, one requires two values, i.e. the total number of shares of the company traded over a period and its outstanding shares during that period. The first one can be treated as the trading volume that were bought and sold over a period. The second value is actually the total number of shares held by all the shareholders. These shares can be issued to investors or traders for purchase.	Share Turnover (Ratio) = Total Number of Shares Traded/Total Number of Shares Outstanding	Share turnover ratio indicates a stock’s liquidity i.e. how easily can it be converted into cash or how easy it is to sell shares. The higher the chances of converting shares into cash, the higher will be the chances of the shares getting sold in the market. Share turnover ratio can help one determine how easily an investor can invest in a company. However, it is not necessary that the ratio will provide you the exact picture of the performance of a stock. If a smaller number of investors are interested in investing in a stock, this will result in a low turnover. But if there are more traders or investors showing interest in a company’s stock/shares, it will give a higher turnover ratio."
89,0,Sharpe Ratio,"Definition: Sharpe ratio is the measure of risk-adjusted return of a financial portfolio. A portfolio with a higher Sharpe ratio is considered superior relative to its peers. The measure was named after William F Sharpe, a Nobel laureate and professor of finance, emeritus at Stanford University.Description: Sharpe ratio is a measure of excess portfolio return over the risk-free rate relative to its standard deviation. Normally, the 90-day Treasury bill rate is taken as the proxy for risk-free rate.	The formula for calculating the Sharpe ratio is {R (p) – R (f)} /s (p)	Where	R (p): Portfolio return	R (f): Risk free rate of return	s (p): Standard deviation of the portfolio	Realised historical return is used to calculate ex-post Sharpe ratio while ex-ante Sharpe ratio employs expected return.	If two funds offer similar returns, the one with higher standard deviation will have a lower Sharpe ratio. In order to compensate for the higher standard deviation, the fund needs to generate a higher return to maintain a higher Sharpe ratio. In simple terms, it shows how much additional return an investor earns by taking additional risk. Intuitively, it can be inferred that the Sharpe ratio of a risk-free asset is zero.	Portfolio diversification with assets having low to negative correlation tends to reduce the overall portfolio risk and consequently increases the Sharpe ratio. For instance, let’s take a portfolio that comprises 50 per cent equity and 50 per cent bonds with a portfolio return of 20 per cent and a standard deviation of 10 per cent. Let’s take the risk-free rate to be 5 per cent. In this case, the Sharpe ratio will be 1.5 [(20%-5%)/10%]. Let’s add another asset class to the portfolio, namely a hedge fund, and tweak the portfolio allocation to 50 per cent in equity, 40 per cent in bonds and 10 per cent in the hedge fund. After the addition, the portfolio return becomes 25 per cent and standard deviation remains at 10 per cent. If the risk-free rate is taken as 5 per cent, the new Sharpe ratio will be 2 [(25%-5%)/10%].	This shows that the addition of a new asset can give a fillip to the overall portfolio return without adding any undue risk. This has the effect of augmenting the Sharpe ratio. 	The Sharpe ratio, however, is a relative measure of risk-adjusted return. If considered in isolation, it does not provide much information about the fund’s performance. Moreover, the measure considers standard deviation, which assumes a symmetrical distribution of returns. For asymmetrical return distribution with a Skewness greater or lesser than zero and Kurtosis greater or lesser than 3, the Sharpe ratio may not be a good measure of performance.	Considering standard deviation as a proxy for risk has its pitfalls. Standard deviation takes into account both the positive as well as the negative deviation in returns from the mean, hence it doesn’t accurately measure the downside risk. Measures like Sortino, which only considers negative deviation from the mean return, can remove the limitation of Sharpe ratio to some extent."
90,0,Squaring Off,"Definition: Squaring off is a trading style used by investors/traders mostly in day trading, in which a trader buys or sells a particular quantity of an asset (mostly stocks) and later in the day reverses the transaction, in the hope of earning a profit (price difference net of broker charges and tax).Description: For example: Person A buys 100 shares of Reliance from the BSE Sensex through a broker for a price or Rs 10 per share. Later in the day, Person A sells all the shares for Rs 12 per share and by paying broker charges of Rs 10. The net profit A earns is Rs (200-10)=Rs 190.	Therefore, the trader has basically squared off his position.Also see: LIBOR, MIBOR, Money Market"
91,0,Standard Deviation,"Definition: Standard deviation is the measure of dispersion of a set of data from its mean. It measures the absolute variability of a distribution; the higher the dispersion or variability, the greater is the standard deviation and greater will be the magnitude of the deviation of the value from their mean.Description: The concept of Standard Deviation was introduced by Karl Pearson in 1893. It is by far the most important and widely used measure of dispersion. Its significance lies in the fact that it is free from those defects which afflicted earlier methods and satisfies most of the properties of a good measure of dispersion. Standard Deviation is also known as root-mean square deviation as it is the square root of means of the squared deviations from the arithmetic mean.In financial terms, standard deviation is used -to measure risks involved in an investment instrument. Standard deviation provides investors a mathematical basis for decisions to be made regarding their investment in financial market. Standard Deviation is a common term used in deals involving stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and others. Standard Deviation is also known as volatility. It gives a sense of how dispersed the data in a sample is from the mean.In case of individual observations, Standard Deviation can be computed in any of the two ways:1. Take the deviation of the items from the actual mean2. Take the deviation of the item from the assumed meanIn case of a discrete series, any of the following methods can be used to calculate Standard Deviation:1. Actual mean method2. Assumed mean method3. Step deviation method"
92,0,Stochastic Oscillator,"Definition: Stochastic Oscillator is one of the important tools used for technical analysis in securities trading. This technique was developed in late 1950s by Dr. George Lane. The indicator picks one observation point in current base and refers to all points in the defined range from where the highest and lowest point are considered for comparison. It helps to decide the current momentum when compared to high & low of historic set in form of support and resistance levels. For this the consideration point is price of the security in a term defined but it never follows the price pattern as it tracks the momentum or oscillation in the price movement. Dr. Lane stated the fact of rule “the momentum changes before the price moves to that direction” on the basis of which this tool was developed.Description: Stochastic compares the deviation or difference of current point with highest and lowest point in a specified period and the formula used is explained below:%K = 100*((C – L(N)) / (H(N) – L(N))where,%K is the derived indicator valueC is the current price pointL is the lowest price point over a specified periodH is the highest price point over a specified periodN is the defined period which can 5, 10, 14, 21 etc normally 14 is widely used periodBy using this formula we can calculate different points of %K for a period of time in historic data set by dividing the data in different clusters e.g. 14 which can days, weeks, months etc. These points are then plotted on a graph as line chart. The %K value describes the level of current price in the look back high-low range considered, if its near 0% then that is termed as near bottom level and if it’s near 100% that is termed as near highest level. This indicator results can be quite abrupt due to its sensitivity to market movements, which can be minimized by averaging the price points. This means by taking moving average whether simple, exponential or weighted etc. which is 3-day moving average as explained below:%D = (K1+K2+K3)/3where,%D is 3 day moving average of %K valuesUsually a simple moving average is considered for above calculation. Average values derived are then plotted on graph along with %K line where we study the divergence between %D and %K of the security in question. Now evolved concept has been introduced in the study of stochastic oscillator which is Fast Stochastic Oscillator and Slow Stochastic Oscillator where Fast one is calculation of %K & %D and slow one is 3-day simple moving average of %D%D-Slow = ((D1+D2+D3)/3)This theory explains that current price will follow the price trend, if it’s on upward direction. Price will close near that or vice versa but stochastic will show the momentum or trend reversals in advance when %K crosses through 3-day %D or %D-Slow from bottom or top. The main points of stochastic oscillator are:a) Calculation of %K where- time periods – which the user can define, mostly used period is 14- data set price, volume, returns where required points are current value, highest & lowest value in one time periodb) Calculation of %D where- time period – which 3 day- moving average of %K valuesExample:Take a default period 14-day for calculation %K- In the first cluster, take price values of last 14 days excluding the current. From the cluster then pick highest price and lowest price points now calculate by using formula e.g. current price is 7950.50, highest value is 8055.00 and lowest is 7691.20 so%K = 100*((7950.50-7691.20) / (8055.00-7691.20)) = 71.27 which shows it’s towards higher rangeLikewise %K values are calculated for every clusterNow calculate %D which 3-Day simple moving average of %K- In the first cluster take first three %K values e.g.%D = (72+71.27+70.73)/3 = 71.33Similarly %D values are calculated for whole setSource – EconomicTimes.com Technical charting toolhttp://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/technical-chartsAt EconomicTimes.com, there are technical analysis tools to calculate simple stochastic oscillator but also stochastic momentum index where fast & slow oscillation can be defined and different averaging methods can be used for calculation of %D.These are some of important points highlighted how to interpret Stochastic Oscillator, there are two lines plotted on graph along with price line 1) %K and 2) %D· These lines generally shows bullish/bearish crossover, strength of upward/downward divergence or over bought/sold scenarios· When %K or % D falls near 0% then it’s a buy signal or when it is near 100% then sell at those levels as it shows overbought and oversold situations· When %K line rises above the %D line then buy and when it falls below the %D line then sell· Divergence is simply gap between %K and %D lines· Bullish market is seen where prices are constantly touching new highs and on same time the Stochastic Oscillator is not able to breach its previous highs and gap is greater that’s a upward divergence· Where gap decreases or two lines come closer that shows downward divergence· When the %K line intersects %D line that shows a crossover· When %K line crosses above the %D line, the security is gaining at a fast momentum than the average which is represented by the %D line and it’s a buy signal· A sell signal is seen when %K line is crossing under the %D line which shows security market is declining"
93,0,Stock Market,"Definition: It is a place where shares of pubic listed companies are traded. The primary market is where companies float shares to the general public in an initial public offering (IPO) to raise capital.Description: Once new securities have been sold in the primary market, they are traded in the secondary market—where one investor buys shares from another investor at the prevailing market price or at whatever price both the buyer and seller agree upon. The secondary market or the stock exchanges are regulated by the regulatory authority. In India, the secondary and primary markets are governed by the Security and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).A stock exchange facilitates stock brokers to trade company stocks and other securities. A stock may be bought or sold only if it is listed on an exchange. Thus, it is the meeting place of the stock buyers and sellers. India's premier stock exchanges are the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange."
94,0,Stocks,"Definition: A stock is a general term used to describe the ownership certificates of any company. A share, on the other hand, refers to the stock certificate of a particular company. Holding a particular company's share makes you a shareholder.Description: Stocks are of two types—common and preferred. The difference is while the holder of the former has voting rights that can be exercised in corporate decisions, the later doesn't. However, preferred shareholders are legally entitled to receive a certain level of dividend payments before any dividends can be issued to other shareholders.There is also something called 'convertible preferred stock'. This is basically a preferred stock with an option of converting into a fixed number of common shares, usually any time after a predetermined date."
95,0,Stock Split,"Definition: When a company declares a stock split, the number of shares of that company increases, but the market cap remains the same. Existing shares split, but the underlying value remains the same. As the number of shares increases, price per share goes down.Description: Stock split is done to infuse liquidity and to make shares affordable for various investors who could not buy the shares of that company before due to high prices.	People often confuse bonus shares with stock split. Distribution of bonus shares only changes its issued share capital whereas stock split splits the company's authorized share capital.Also see: Bonus Shares, Stock, Equity, Liquidity"
96,0,Stop Loss,"Definition: Stop-loss can be defined as an advance order to sell an asset when it reaches a particular price point. It is used to limit loss or gain in a trade. The concept can be used for short-term as well as long-term trading. This is an automatic order that an investor places with the broker/agent by paying a certain amount of brokerage. Stop-loss is also known as ‘stop order’ or ‘stop-market order’. By placing a stop-loss order, the investor instructs the broker/agent to sell a security when it reaches a pre-set price limit.Description: In case of a stop-loss order, the trading company or broker looks at the trading discipline to help the investor cut losses by the current market bid price (i.e. the highest price for the stock at any point of time at which the investor wants to place a bid), and vice-versa, while selling a stock.	For example, if investor ABC wants to place a bid for shares of XYZ company at a certain price point, he/she would instruct his/her brokerage to set the limit against the stock purchase. When the stock reaches the set bid price, an order will be executed automatically to purchase the same.	If you already own the shares of company X and want to sell them, you would ask your broker to sell them when the price reaches at certain high or low. Accordingly, an automatic order will get triggered once the price range matches the set limits.	A stop-loss order is basically a tool used for short-term investment planning. It is used when the investor doesn’t want the pressure of monitoring a security on a day-to-day basis. The trade gets triggered automatically and the limits are decided in advance. This can be very helpful for small investors."
97,0,Straddle,"DEFINITION: A straddle is a trading strategy that involves options. To use a straddle, a trader buys/sells a Call option and a Put option simultaneously for the same underlying asset at a certain point of time provided both options have the same expiry date and same strike price. A trader enters such a neutral combination of trades when the price movement is not clear. In an ideal situation, the two opposite trades can offset losses if either of the options fails. In this strategy, one can go ‘either’ long (buy) on both options i.e. Call & Put, ‘or’ short (sell) both. The eventual outcome of the strategy depends entirely on the quantum of price movement on the security in question. In other words, the degree of price movement, rather than the direction of price movement, affects the outcome.	A straddle strategy involves the following:	1)      Either buying or selling of call/put options,	2)      The options should have the same underlying asset,	3)      They should be traded at the same strike price,	4)      And they must have same expiry date/expirationDESCRIPTION: A straddle option works on the neutral ground that price can move in either direction, but the movement should be volatile. To get best results from the strategy, one should go for a straddle strategy when there is enough time to expiry. A trader should enter at-the-money options (means the strike price of the options should be equal to the price of the underlying) or close to it at the time of purchase or sale. The idea is to benefit when there are high/low price variations so that the new values of Call/Put options are far greater/lesser than the values when the strategy was started. This can offset the cost of the trade and the remainder can be profit. Cost for any straddle involves two points:	·        Call option – Premium (value of option)	·        Put option – Premium (value of option)	Example: Suppose the Tata Motors stock is trading at Rs 383.15. Now suppose a trader has begun a long straddle by buying one lot each of November series put option and call option at strike price Rs 380 for Rs 21 (Call) and Rs 18.15 (Put). The cost of the trader at this point of time is Rs 39.15 (Rs 21+Rs 18.15). If the strategy fails, this will be the maximum possible loss for the trader. If Tata Motors trades at around Rs 450 at the expiry of the November series, then the Put option will expire worthless, as it will turn out-of-the-money (which means the strike price is less than the trading price). But the Call option is in-the-money (the strike price is less than trading price) and on expiry, the payout on the Call option will be (Rs 450-Rs 380) = Rs 70. If the initial cost of Rs 39.15 is subtracted, it will leave a profit of Rs 30.85 on the trade. Further commission and exchange taxes will be deducted on the actual profit/loss.	Suppose the trader decides to exit the strategy before expiry, when Tata Motors trades at around Rs 380 in cash market, say, the Call option trades at Rs 5 and the Put option at Rs 30 (value of Call option is less, as chances are it will expire worthless.)	In this case, the payout will be:	Call option – (Rs 5- Rs 21) = (-) Rs 15 (loss)	Put option – (Rs 30- Rs 18.15) = Rs 11.85 (profit)	Net profit/loss = (-)Rs 3.15 plus commission and exchange taxes	A straddle is not a risk-free proposition and can fail in a dull market. In a long straddle, a trader can suffer maximum loss when both options expire at-the-money, thus turning them worthless. In such a case, the trader has to pay the difference between the value of premiums plus commissions on both option trades. In case of a short straddle, the loss can actually be manifold. For safer implementation, a straddle should be constructed at a time when it is not close to the expiry date. The trader should not keep it open till the expiry date, as chances of a failure are often quite high nearer to expiry.	One can also look at the implied volatility of the market to determine the best time to buy or sell options.	a)      Low implied volatility can be a buy/entry signal for a ‘long straddle’	b)      High implied volatility can be a buy/entry signal for a ‘short straddle’Long Straddle: This involves buying both Call and Put options with the same expiry date, strike price and underlying security (index, commodity, currency, interest rates). The best time to buy Call/Put options is when they are undervalued or discounted irrespective of how the spot price of the security moves. The strategy involves limited risk, as the cost of both the options is the maximum value that the trader can lose in this trade.	Breakeven points for a long straddle are:	Upper breakeven point = Long Call option (strike price + premium paid (value of option)	Lower breakeven point = Long Put option (strike price – premium paid (value of option)Short Straddle: This involves selling both call and put options with the same expiry date, strike price and underlying security (index, commodity, currency, interest rates). The best time to sell call/put options is when they are overvalued irrespective of where the spot price of security moves and by how much. This strategy involves unlimited risk, as one may lose up to entire value of the security in case of sale of both options, but profit will be limited to the premiums received on both options.	Breakeven points for short straddle strategy are:	Upper breakeven point = Short Call option (strike price + premium received(value of option)	Lower breakeven point = Short Put option (strike price – premium received (value of option)	Source YouTube Channel: Khan Academy"
98,0,Strangle,"Definition: A strangle is an options trading strategy in which a trader buys and sells a Call option and a Put option of the same underlying asset simultaneously at different strike prices but with the same maturity. Usually, a trader constructs such a neutral combination of trades when the direction of price movement is not clear but chances of sharp movements are high. In this strategy, one can go ‘either’ long (buy) on both options i.e. Call & Put ‘or’ short (sell) both but at different strike prices. In this strategy, trading on a slightly out-of-money Call and Put is considered along with some degree of movement.	So any strangle strategy involves following points:	1)      Buying or selling of Call/Put options	2)      Both options should have same underlying asset	3)      Options are bought at different strike prices	4)      They have the same expiry date/expirationDescription: A strangle strategy works on the assumption that prices can move in either direction but the degree of movement can be volatile. For best results from the strategy, one should construct a strangle by buying and selling out-of-money (means strike price of options is not equal to the price of underlying) options.	How is it different from a straddle?	1)      A strangle has different strike prices for both options; a straddle has same strike price	2)      Out-of-money options are considered for strangle while at-the-money options are used in a straddle	3)      Trading cost is relatively less in a strangle compared with a straddle, because the former options trade out-of-money        	A strangle offers chances of unlimited profitability, when prices move considerably in either direction. The cost for a strangle involves two components:	·         Call option – Premium (value of option)	·         Put option – Premium (value of option)	Example: Suppose, the Reliance Industries stock is trading at Rs 944.50. Now a trader enters a long strangle by buying 1 lot each of November series Put option and Call option at strike prices Rs 960 (Call) and Rs 940 (Put) for Rs 22.65 (Call) and Rs 20.35 (Put). So, the trader’s cost at this point of time is Rs 43 (Rs 22.65+Rs 20.35). If the strategy fails, this will be the maximum possible loss for the trader.	If Reliance Industries trades at Rs 1,100 on the expiry date in November, then the Put option will expire worthless as it will turn out-of-money (strike price is less than trading price) while the Call option will become in-the-money (strike price is less than trading price). On expiry, the payout of the Call option will be (Rs 1,100-Rs 960) = Rs 140. After subtracting the initial cost of Rs 43, the profit will be Rs 97. Commission and exchange taxes will be deducted from this to arrive at the actual profit/loss.	But if the trader decides to exit this strategy before expiry, say when the Reliance Industries stock is trading around Rs 960 in cash market, the Call option is at Rs 30 and the put option is at Rs 5 (value of the put option is less as chances are it will expire worthless). So, the payout will be:	Call option – (Rs 30- Rs 22.65) = Rs 7.35 (profit)	Put option – (Rs 5- Rs 20.35) = (-)Rs 15.65 (loss)	Net profit/loss = (-) Rs 8.30 plus commission and exchange taxes	Strangle is a limited risk proposition. In a long strangle, the trader suffers maximum loss when the cash price is between the strike prices of both the options, which makes both the options worthless on expiry and the trader has to pay the difference in value of premiums plus commissions on both option trades. In case of a short strangle, the loss can be manifold. For safer implementation, refer to implied volatility to get signals whether it’s the best time to buy or sell options,	a)      Low implied volatility gives buy/entry signal for ‘long strangle’	b)      High implied volatility gives sell/entry signal for ‘short strangle’Long Strangle: This means buying both call and put options with same expiry date and same security (index, commodity, currency, interest rates) but at different strike prices. The best time to buy Call/Put options is when they are undervalued or discounted or out-of-money irrespective of where the spot price of the security moves. This strategy involves limited risk as the cost of the options is the maximum loss that the trader can incur and that will happen when the price of the underlying is between the strike prices of the Call & Put option on expiry. Profitability is maximum in case of long strangle when both options are in-the-money on expiry.	Breakeven points for long strangle strategy are:	    Upper Breakeven Point = Long Call Option (Strike Price + Premium paid (Value of option)	    Lower Breakeven Point = Long Put Option (Strike Price – Premium paid (Value of option)Short Strangle: This means selling both Call and Put options with same expiry date, different strike prices and same security (index, commodity, currency, interest rates). The best time to sell Call/Put options is when they are overvalued or slightly out-of-money irrespective of where security spot price moves and what the degree of movement is in the near future. This strategy involves unlimited risk, as the trader may lose up to value of the security in case of selling both the options but the profit can be limited to the premiums received on both the options only when the underlying price is between the strike prices of the options.	 	 Breakeven points for short strangle strategy are:	    Upper Breakeven Point = Short Call Option (Strike Price + Premium received(Value of option)	    Lower Breakeven Point = Short Put Option (Strike Price – Premium received (Value of option)	Source YouTube Channel: Finideas Sol	Source YouTube Channel: Option Alpha"
99,0,Strike Price,"Definition: Strike price is the pre-determined price at which the buyer and seller of an option agree on a contract or exercise a valid and unexpired option. While exercising a call option, the option holder buys the asset from the seller, while in the case of a put option, the option holder sells the asset to the seller.	In case of both call and put options, the strike price remains the same through the life of the contract. The difference between the strike price and the current market price (or the underlying price) is one of the inputs that determine the price or premium, which, in turn, decides whether the option is in-the-money or out-of-the-money. Usually, in-the-money options are more expensive than out-of-the-money options.Description: Strike price is an important element to any option contract, as exercising of an option contract takes place on the strike price, and not on the market price of the underlying.	The difference between the strike price and market price on exercising an option shows profit per share for the option holder.	1)      In Call option, if the strike price is less than market price on the day of expiry, the ‘call option buyer’ will exercise the same and the price difference will be his profit	2)      In Put option, if the strike price is more than the market price on the day of expiry, the ‘put option buyer’ will exercise the same and the price difference will be his profit	3)      If holder of an option does not exercise the option, he has to pay ‘option premium’ to the other party, and not the strike price	(When a Call option is exercised, the buyer of the option buys the asset from the option seller. In case of a Put option, the option buyer sells the asset to the seller of the Put option).	Example:	On National Stock Exchange (India), suppose Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is trading at Rs 2,531.50 in the cash market. Now a trader wants to buy TCS shares at this price, as he is expecting the stock to jump in the near future, but not very certain about it. To avoid risk, he trades in NSE derivatives market and buys TCS Call option (November) expiry at strike price Rs 2,500 at a market premium of Rs 70.50. On the day of expiry, TCS stock price jumps to Rs 2,600. Now when the trader exercises the option, as he will get shares at less than market price. But if TCS stock had tumbled to Rs 2,480 in cash market on the day of expiry, this option would have expired out-of-the-money.	The strike price for an option remains the same through the entire life of the contract (till expiry date). The difference between the strike price and the current market price of the underlying asset is one of the inputs that determine the market price of the option or option premium in the derivatives market. This difference decides the ‘status’ of an option, which is whether the option is ‘in-the-money’, ‘at-the-money’ or ‘out-of-the-money’. Usually ‘in-the-money’ options are more expensive to buy than out-of-the-money options. So when a trader buys or sells options expiring in the same month, he should consider the strike price and the market price.	At any point of time, there can be multiple Call and Put options on the derivative exchanges and every option will have a defined strike price with an expiry date. So strike price for any security can be explained with ‘option chain’, which has all listed call and put options with strike prices on one particular expiry date.	See the example below, the Option chain of a stock on the derivative exchange with November expiry when the market price of the securities is Rs 2,540. The rates highlighted in blue are in-the-money, because	a)      in case of Call option, Strike Price < Market Price and	b)      in case of Put option, Strike Price > Market Price	Derivatives exchange offer a range of strike prices for a security, which depends on market price and volatility expected in that security in the future, based on its past and current performance. This range percentage is different for all different underlying. So while picking strike price, consider the implied volatility and market price of that underlying.

100,0,Tick Size,"Definition: Tick size is the minimum price change between different bid and offer prices of an asset traded on an exchange platform. It is the minimum price difference that must exist at all times between consecutive bid and offer prices. In other words, it is the minimum increment in which prices can change. For example, if a stock has a tick size of Rs 0.05 and if the last traded price (LTP) was Rs 100, then the next five best bid prices for the stock shall be Rs 99.95, Rs 99.90, Rs 99.85, Rs 99.80 and Rs 99.75. In this instance, the bid price cannot be Rs 99.87, say, as it does not meet the tick size of Rs 0.05.	Description: Suppose the LTP of a stock is Rs 100, i.e. last time the stock traded at Rs 100 on a particular exchange, say the National Stock Exchange or NSE, and the tick size is Rs 0.05.	At the LTP of Rs 100, the bid-offer window of the stock shall look something like this:	In the above table we can see that the best bid price is Rs 99.90, instead of Rs 99.95, even though the LTP is Rs 100. This is because there is no bid at Rs 99.95, i.e. the quantity bid at Rs 99.95 is zero. Similarly, there is no offer price at Rs 100.15 after Rs 100.10, instead the next best offer price is Rs 100.10, i.e. again the quantity offered at Rs 100.15 is zero.	Thus, whenever there is no quantity bid at a particular price, that particular price is not shown in the bid column, instead the price at the next tick (i.e. 0.05) is shown. This goes on till a maximum of five bid prices are visible in the column. A similar logic applies to the offer price column."
101,0,Treynor Ratio,"Definition: Treynor ratio shows the risk adjusted performance of the fund. Here the denominator is the beta of the portfolio. Thus, it takes into account the systematic risk of the portfolio.Description: Jack Treynor extended the work of William Sharpe by formulating treynor ratio. Treynor ratio is similar to Sharpe ratio, but the only difference between the ratios is that of the denominator.Formula for Treynor ratio: (Rp-Rf)/Beta 	where,Rp: Return on the portfolioRf: Risk free rateB: Beta, the sensitivity of the portfolio to changes in the overall market.	Unlike Sharpe, Treynor uses beta in the denominator instead of the standard deviation. The beta measures only the portfolio's sensitivity to the market movement, while the standard deviation is a measure of the total volatility both upside as well as downside. A fund with a higher Treynor ratio implies that the fund has a better risk adjusted return than that of another fund with a lower Treynor ratio.Also See: Beta, Sharpe Ratio"
102,0,Tunneling,"Definition: Tunneling is an unethical business practice in which majority shareholders transfer a company’s assets to privately-owned firms or utilise profits in such activities that benefit them at the expense of minority shareholders.	Such actions may include sale of assets at lower valuations to a firm owned by majority shareholders, dilutive share measures, excessive executive compensation and personal loan guarantees. The key feature of tunneling is that the stakeholders, who engage in the activity, usually comply with all of the relevant legal procedures for personal gains.	Tunneling is an unethical business practice in which majority shareholders transfer a company’s assets to privately-owned firms or utilise profits in such activities that benefit them at the expense of minority shareholders.	Such actions may include sale of assets at lower valuations to a firm owned by majority shareholders, dilutive share measures, excessive executive compensation and personal loan guarantees. The key feature of tunneling is that the stakeholders, who engage in the activity, usually comply with all of the relevant legal procedures for personal gains.Description: Tunneling is broadly classified in three categories. First is called cash flow tunneling, which includes diversion of ongoing cash flow in favour of majority stakeholders. Examples of cash flow tunneling include transfer pricing arrangements where the majority shareholder, or a company in which the controller has substantial stake, sells inputs to the company at a price above the prevailing market price or purchases the firm’s output at lower prices.	It can also include unwarranted high cash compensation to top executives. Taking loan from the company at a rate below the prevailing market price is also considered cash flow tunneling.	The second type is called asset tunneling. It can further be divided into asset tunneling in and asset tunneling out. Asset tunneling out involves transfer of long-term assets from the firm for less than market value. It includes underpriced asset sale to affiliated firms. Asset tunneling in, on the other hand, involves a company acquiring major assets of affiliated firms at a price more than its market value.	Lastly, there is equity tunneling. In this case, majority shareholders hike their stake in a firm at the expense of minority shareholders. Examples of equity tunneling include insider trading, dilutive offerings, loans to insiders and equity-based incentive/compensation that exceeds market standards.	All the three tunneling categories differ from each other. Unlike cash flow tunneling, which impacts near-term cash flow of a firm, asset tunneling transfers have a permanent effect on the firm’s future cash-generating capacity. Equity tunneling changes the shareholding pattern but does not directly change the firm’s productive assets or cash flows."
103,0,Underlying Asset,"Definition: An underlying asset is the security on which a derivative contract is based upon. The price of the derivative may be directly correlated (e.g. call option) or inversely correlated (e.g. put option), to the price of the underlying asset. An underlying asset can be a stock, commodity, index, currency or even another derivative (E.g. volatility index, VIX) product. Some exotic derivatives, like weather derivatives, may even have a non-financial entity as their underlying asset.Description: Most of the times the underlying asset trades in a spot market (especially when the underlying is a financial asset), where there needs to be a full upfront payment to acquire the asset (or within a period of 1-2 days). Derivatives based on such assets usually do not require a 100 per cent upfront payment to take exposure to them, thereby incorporating an inherent element of leverage in them. Most of the listed stocks that trade on the stock exchanges are underlying asset of the various futures and options contracts based upon them. Consider a stock, say ITC, which trades on the Indian stock exchanges. Now, the ITC stock is the underlying asset traded on NSE or BSE and some of the derivatives that have this stock as underlying are:	A. Futures	a. 1-month futures contract (Near month)	b. 2-month futures contract	c. 3-month futures contract (Far month)	B. Options	a. 1-month Call options at various strike prices	b. 2-month Call options at various strike prices	c. 3-month Call options at various strike prices	d. 1-month Put options at various strike prices	e. 2-month Put options at various strike prices	f. 3-month Put options at various strike prices"
104,0,Volatility,"Definition: It is a rate at which the price of a security increases or decreases for a given set of returns. Volatility is measured by calculating the standard deviation of the annualized returns over a given period of time. It shows the range to which the price of a security may increase or decrease.Description: Volatility measures the risk of a security. It is used in option pricing formula to gauge the fluctuations in the returns of the underlying assets. Volatility indicates the pricing behavior of the security and helps estimate the fluctuations that may happen in a short period of time.	If the prices of a security fluctuate rapidly in a short time span, it is termed to have high volatility. If the prices of a security fluctuate slowly in a longer time span, it is termed to have low volatility."
105,0,Yield,"Definition: In financial terms, yield is used to describe a certain amount earned on a security, over a particular period of time. It refers to the interest or dividend earned on debt or equity, respectively, and is conventionally expressed annually as a percentage based on the current market value or face value of the security.Description: Yield is a major decision-making tool used by both companies and investors. It is a financial ratio that indicates how much a company pays in dividend/interest to investors, each year, relative to the security price. Yield is a measure of cash flow that an investor is getting on the money invested in a security.	Suppose, a person A invests Rs 100 per share in the securities of XYZ Ltd for an annual return of Rs 10, and B, another person, invests Rs 200 in the securities of ABC Ltd and gets the same return as A, i.e. Rs 10. Here the yield of A and B is 10% & 5%. While both are earning the same amount, B is getting less return as he/she has invested a higher amount than A.	Similarly, gains on stock prices also accrue profits to investors. This is why stocks with less growth potential are more likely to offer higher dividend yield to investors than stocks with high growth potential and, therefore, there is a better chance of earning returns from price appreciation. Yield varies between investment period and return period. For instance, if you buy a stock for Rs 50 and its current price and annual dividend is Rs 53 and Rs 2, respectively, the ‘cost yield’ will be 4% (Rs 2/Rs 50) and the ‘current yield’ will be 3.77% (Rs 2/Rs 53)."
