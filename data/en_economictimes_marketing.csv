0,0,5 Forces Analysis Of The Environment,"Definition: The five forces model of analysis was developed by Michael Porter to analyze the competitive environment in which a product or company works.Description: There are five forces that act on any product/ brand/ company:1. The threat of entry: competitors can enter from any industry, channel, function, form or marketing activity. How best can the company take care of the threat of new entrants?2. Supplier power: what is the power of suppliers in this industry? How will their actions affect costs, supplies and developments? If there are a few suppliers, power is in their favour and cost of switching may be prohibitive; vice versa for a situation with lots of suppliers. There may be too many buyers from too few suppliers.3. Buyer power: there may be few buyers for the product, which could mean that they would drive down prices and dictate business terms. What is their effect on the business? If there are many buyers, sellers could decide not to supply to a few, because other buyers will step in.4. Threat of substitutes: can another substitute the product? Tea for coffee; email for fax? What is the likely possibility of this and what is its impact?5. Competitive rivalry: all the four forces may come together to produce this force. All the resources at a company's disposal may be put in to maintain market shares and sales. How intense is competitive action, can it be countered?"
1,0,Advertising,"Definition: Advertising is a means of communication with the users of a product or service. Advertisements are messages paid for by those who send them and are intended to inform or influence people who receive them, as defined by the Advertising Association of the UK.Description: Advertising is always present, though people may not be aware of it. In today's world, advertising uses every possible media to get its message through. It does this via television, print (newspapers, magazines, journals etc), radio, press, internet, direct selling, hoardings, mailers, contests, sponsorships, posters, clothes, events, colours, sounds, visuals and even people (endorsements).The advertising industry is made of companies that advertise, agencies that create the advertisements, media that carries the ads, and a host of people like copy editors, visualizers, brand managers, researchers, creative heads and designers who take it the last mile to the customer or receiver. A company that needs to advertise itself and/or its products hires an advertising agency. The company briefs the agency on the brand, its imagery, the ideals and values behind it, the target segments and so on. The agencies convert the ideas and concepts to create the visuals, text, layouts and themes to communicate with the user. After approval from the client, the ads go on air, as per the bookings done by the agency's media buying unit.What is advertising? Watch video..."
2,0,Advertorial,"Definition: An advertorial is a form of advertisement in a newspaper, magazine or a website which involves giving information about the product in the form of an article. Usually, a brand pays the publisher for such an article.Description: Advertorials are advertisements that appear in the media, be it magazines, newspapers or websites. Advertorials are paid content.	They are used by marketers to educate prospective consumers about the features of a product. It can be used to target a specific set of people by choosing the right medium to publish the advertorial.	For example, an advertorial in a business newspaper would involve educating a set of people who are more interested about economy, markets or financial products.	It is an effective medium for a company to connect with its consumers through a story, unlike a traditional print ad in a magazine, newspaper or on a website as a banner ad.	An advertorial is more detailed than an advertisement and thus helps consumers understand more about the product. Advertorials are usually written by an ad agency or the client itself. They then purchase the ad space on the website or in a newspaper or a magazine.	It is important to note that as a rule of most publications, the word ""advertisement"" is mostly printed in small letters at the top or bottom of your advertorial. Some newspapers or magazines chose to push these advertorials in special sections."
3,0,Ambient Advertising,"Definition: Ambient Advertising is about placing ads on unusual objects or in unusual places where you wouldn’t usually expect to have an advertisement.Description: Ambient advertising evolved as a concept because it has a lasting impact on the minds of consumers which makes it more effective. Ambient advertising is all about creativity, and how effectively the advertiser is able to communicate the message to the consumers.The term 'ambient' means placing the ad at unusual places or unconventional places were you wouldn't expect an advertisement. Ambient advertising can be done along with traditional means of advertisement or as a standalone form of communication.The idea behind ambient advertising is to surprise consumers with its placement. For example, advertising behind a car is not unusual, but using wiper as a part of adverting will look something different and will throw an element of surprise in the minds of consumers.Ambient advertising makes an impact because it is intelligently placed, has a wow factor to it, makes a direct impact on the mind of consumers, effective way of communicating the message across to target consumers etc.The first thing that will catch your eye when you are looking at an ambient advertisement would be its unusual location. The second characteristics of such an advertising is the fact that there is no repetition.Another thing which is important is the execution. How well the ad is being executed, or does it really creating an impact that was required for effective communication. Does it really have a wow factor? All these things are taken into consideration while designing an ambient advertising campaign."
4,0,Ambush Marketing,"Definition: Ambush marketing, a term first coined by marketing guru Jerry Welsh, has not really been rigorously defined. However, it broadly refers to a situation in which a company or product seeks to ride on the publicity value of a major event without having contributed to the financing of the event through sponsorship. It is typically targeted at major sporting events - like the Olympic Games or the world cups in various games - and is a strategy adopted by rivals of the official sponsors.Description: What forms does ambush marketing typically take? In its more crude forms, ambush marketing could involve unauthorised use of logos or designs associated with the event. More often, however, ambush marketing involves more subtle forms of confusing or misleading the public about who are actually sponsoring the event. "
5,0,Behavioural Segmentaion,"Definition: Behavioral segmentation is a more focused form of market segmentation that groups different consumers based on specific behavioral patterns they display when making buying a product.Description: Behavioral segmentation classifies organizations and individuals into different categories based on how they act or behave towards products. It involves classifying consumers or grouping them based on frequency with which they use or buy the company’s product.	Grouping patterns may include analyzing consumer behaviors based on certain factors such as spending habits, consumption, lifestyle, usage of the product, etc.	Behavioral segmentation enables the company to adapt their marketing approach to target groups, so that they can learn more about consumers' overall needs. By doing this, a company can strengthen its marketing message or brand recall in the target group.	Similarly, companies who use behavioral segmentation are also interested in the behavioral pattern of non-users to find out how they can persuade them to buy the product or service.	It is important to understand that consumer’s decisions are affected by his/her behavior, and that is exactly how the behavioral segments are targeted to understand more about the customer and their buying habits.	There are different types of segmentation based on loyalty, occasion, usage rates, readiness stage, usage and benefits sought. For example: When you are buying a toothbrush, what is important to you? Do you look at the price, the manufacturer, its ability to prevent tooth decay, or whiten the teeth? If you want the product to fight tooth decay, the marketer will structure the advertising message in such a way that it matches your need."
6,0,Blue Ocean Strategy,"Definition: 'Blue Ocean Strategy is referred to a market for a product where there is no competition or very less competition. This strategy revolves around searching for a business in which very few firms operate and where there is no pricing pressure.Description: Blue Ocean Strategy can be applied across sectors or businesses. It is not limited to just one business. But, let's first understand what is Blue Ocean and how it is different from Red Ocean strategy.	In today's environment most firms operate under intense competition and try to do everything to gain market share. When the product comes under pricing pressure there is always a possibility that a firm’s operations could well come under threat. This situation usually comes when the business is operating in a saturated market, also known as 'Red Ocean'.	When there is limited room to grow, businesses try and look for verticals or avenues of finding new business where they can enjoy uncontested market share or 'Blue Ocean'. A blue ocean exists when there is potential for higher profits, as there is now competition or irrelevant competition.	The strategy aims to capture new demand, and to make competition irrelevant by introducing a product with superior features. It helps the company in make huge profits as the product can be priced a little steep because of its unique features.	Let's understand Blue Ocean strategy with the help of an example. Apple ventured into digital music in 2003 with its product iTunes.	Apple users can download legal and high quality music at a reasonable price from iTunes making traditional sources of distribution of music irrelevant. Earlier compact disks or CDs were used as a traditional medium to distribute and listen to music.	Apple was successful in capturing the growing demand of music for users on the go. All the available Apple products have iTunes for users to download music."
7,0,Brands,"Definition: A brand is a name given to a product and/or service such that it takes on an identity by itself. Description: In today's marketplace teeming with thousands of products and services, all of which are being rapidly commoditized, a brand stands out from the clutter and attracts attention. 	A brand name can create and stand for loyalty, trust, faith, premium ness or mass-market appeal, depending on how the brand is marketed, advertised and promoted. 	A brand differentiates a product from similar other products and enables it to charge a higher premium, in return for a clear identity and greater faith in its function. A brand is also likely to survive longer than just an undifferentiated product. 		A brand is akin to a living being: it has an identity and personality, name, culture, vision, emotion and intelligence. All these are conferred by the owner of the brand and needs to be continuously looked at to keep the brand relevant to the target it intends to sell to."
8,0,Brand Tribe,"Definition: A brand tribe could be regarded as a group of people who collectively identify themselves with the product and share similar views and notions about the brand. They are not just consumers of the product, but play a major role in its promotion.Description: A product is successful when it becomes a cult. Companies are not just selling consumers their products nowadays, but an idea, a vision as how consumers of the particular brand will relate to it once he/she owns it. 	Creating a tribe or a cult is not possible for every product, but if the company is able to create one product out of their portfolio which can differentiate itself from the competition, it’ll do wonders for the company and the brand.	Brands which have tribal groups rely on certain factors such as loyalty towards the brand such as, trust, usage, and a sense of pride once they purchase the product. Customers tend to remain loyal to the brand year-on-year even if the product is costly as compared to others in the same segment.	Let's understand Brand Tribe with the help of an example. There are lot of brand tribes associated with products such as Apple, BMW, Harley Davidson, Audi, etc. Let's take a look at Mahindra's first sports utility vehicle or SUV, 'Scorpio'.	Scorpio was the first SUV launched by M&M, and it has been a huge success since it was launched. What made the car so special was the image created by the company: a rough and tough vehicle for all roads that gives you the luxury of a big car.	The pricing managed to give the competition a run for their money. It was tough, and at the same time economical and safe. Over a period of time, M&M was able to build a customer-base who would only drive Scorpio.	To support the tribe, the company organises various rally events where Scorpio owners can take part and experiment with their vehicles on a rough terrain. It gives them a sense of belonging which is very important for brand tribe to exist."
9,0,Brand Valuation,"Definition: Brand valuation is the process used to calculate the value of a brand or the amount of money another party is prepared to pay for it.Description: A brand comprises tangible as well as intangible elements relating to the company's style, culture, positioning, messages, promises and value proposition. Brand Valuation, subsequently, is an estimate of the financial value of a brand. There is no universally accepted method for determining brand value. But, each company uses a different model. There are three main types of brand valuation methods - a) the cost approach b) the market approach and c) the income approach. 	Generally, brands are valued higher if the owner has already obtained appropriate legal protection, such as registration. However, companies that choose to value their brands in their balance-sheet use a consistent methodology so that the brands can be analyzed and compared. Determining a value for a brand can be complicated. But, the true value of a brand is ascertainable only when a purchaser and a seller reach an agreement to sell a particular brand. Brand valuation helps companies to find a buyer when it wants to sell it, value the assets in the balance-sheet, and to provide information to investors. Brand valuation comes in handy as security for a loan and tax reasons. It is also a useful tool used in merger and acquisition (M&A) planning, joint venture negotiations, litigation support services, secured borrowing transactions, bankruptcy administration, etc."
10,0,Breakaway Positioning,"Definition: Breakaway positioning is a marketing technique in which customers recognise the product based on its features such as design, functionality, appearance, feel, luxury, distribution channel, pricing, or features. This type of marketing technique helps the brand to create its own image, or niche, which at times leads to impulsive buying.Description: A breakaway campaign stands out, as it is able to connect with the consumer at a different level. 	The brands which follow breakaway strategy always try and maintain their niche. They create their own image in the mind of consumers which can't be associated with any other brand. This helps the brand in retaining their consumers.	Brands create their niche by introducing such features which are not available in any other product or the pricing is such that no other brand can match it, etc. Once the brand establishes itself in this type of strategy, consumers also get interested in other products from the same brand.	A classic example of breakaway brand would be the Apple iPhone. When Apple started promoting its products in a commercial it used a tag line - ""If you don't have an iPhone "".	Here Apple differentiated itself from other mobile manufacturers in terms of features, the quality of its product (voice, data storage, camera, etc.) which are far better than the competition. Consistent improvement in the product from Apple, and new innovations keeps the interest alive in the minds of the consumers.	Once the brand is well placed in the mind of the consumer, its other products such as the iPad also did very well in India as well as across the globe."
11,0,Break-even Pricing,"Definition: Break-even pricing is an accounting pricing methodology in which the price point at which a product will earn zero profit is calculated. In other words, it is the point at which cost is equal to revenue.Description: Break-even pricing is a common tool used by most companies to set the pricing strategy of their portfolio of products. It is computed by the management of a company to make informed decisions in case it wants to increase the production or put a check on costs. The company can choose to set a price which is below the break-even point. But, in that case, the company would be earning revenues and would not be making any profits. So, the main motive of the company would be to increase its market share rather than earning profits. Most of the e-commerce firms are still operating below their break-even point. But, they have been able to tap the market share. This pricing methodology helps the company in setting up the lowest acceptable price. Break-even price is calculated by using this formula = (Total fixed cost/Production unit volume) + Variable Cost per unit. Let's understand with the help of an example. XYZ Ltd is into manufacturing of light bulbs. The fixed cost of manufacturing bulbs turns out to be Rs 50,000 and the variable cost per unit is Rs 10. The company sets an annual target of selling close to 10,000 bulbs. The break-even pricing can be calculated by using fixed cost as well as the target for annual sales. Break-even point = (50,000/10,000)+10 = Rs 15 The break-even price for one bulb is Rs 15, which means that the company can choose to price the product above this price to earn profits. If it chooses to price its product below Rs 15, it would not be earning any profits."
12,0,Cash Cows,"Definition: Cash Cow is one of the four categories under the Boston Consulting Group's growth matrix that represents a division which has a big market share in a low-growth industry or a sector. It is referred to an asset or a business, which once paid off, will continue giving consistent cash flows throughout its life.Description: A Cash Cow is a metaphor used for a business or a product, which exhibits a strong potential in terms of returns in a low-growth market. The rate of return from this business is usually greater than the market growth rate. A company does not have to invest much in the business apart from the initial outlay. Once the company recovers its initial investment, it does not have to put in more cash to keep the business growing. A cash cow is a term used in the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix. A business becomes a cash cow or a dog depending on its performance in the growth stage. Under the growth share matrix model, a business can either become a cash cow if it becomes a market leader in the industry or a dog, which represents a low market share and a low growth rate. Cash generated from cash cows are used to fund other product portfolios of business. It can be used to fund research and development, grow market share or service corporate debt and reduce the overall debt burden on the company. The company can also use the cash to pay dividend to shareholders as well as buy back shares. Cash cows tend to grow at a slow rate, but they are usually market leaders in the industry where there are lot of entry barriers. The presence of entry barriers means that there will be less competition."
13,0,Channel Management,"Definition: The term Channel Management is widely used in sales marketing parlance. It is defined as a process where the company develops various marketing techniques as well as sales strategies to reach the widest possible customer base. The channels are nothing but ways or outlets to market and sell products. The ultimate aim of any organization is to develop a better relationship between the customer and the product.Description: Channel management helps in developing a program for selling and servicing customers within a specific channel. The aim is to streamline communication between a business and the customer. To do this, you need to segment your channels according to the characteristics of your customers: their needs, buying patterns, success factors, etc. and then customize a program that includes goals, policies, products, sales, and marketing program (1). The goal of channel management is to establish direct communication with customers in each channel. If the company is able to effectively achieve this goal, the management will have a better idea which marketing channel best suits that particular customer base. The techniques used in each channel could be different, but the overall strategy must always brand the business consistently throughout the communication (2).	A business must determine what it wants out of each channel and also clearly define the framework for each of those channels to produce desired results. Identifying the segment of the population linked to each channel also helps to determine the best products to pitch to those channels."
14,0,Confirmation Bias,"Definition: Confirmation bias is a psychological phenomenon in which a person tends to accept those references or findings which confirm his/her existing belief in things. Confirmation bias leads to statistical errors, as it influences the way people gather information and interpret it.Description: Humans are complex beings who give weightage to those things or evidence which confirm their beliefs. Despite thinking that they are rational being, ideas are often biased and influenced by information that upholds our ideas.	Confirmation bias is a type of cognitive bias that leads to poor decision-making. It often blinds us when we are looking at a situation. In other words, it prevents us from looking at a situation objectively to make a decision.	For example: Confirmation bias is commonly seen around the election time, when people from all walks of life are in favour of a specific party or an individual who they think is fit to win. When they are asked why they like a particular party such as ABC, they would bring out all the positive information they have about the party or individual.	The very reason they bring out the information is because somewhere down the line they believe in that party and the work that the party intends to do. For example, if your country is suffering from corruption and ABC makes an oath to eliminate or bring down such a practice, you will get attached to the idea."
15,0,Conspicuous Consumption,"Definition: Conspicuous consumption is the practice of purchasing goods or services to publicly display wealth rather than to cover basic needs.Description: The word 'Conspicuous' here means lavish or wasteful spending. This kind of spending is generally made by people who have considerable amount of disposable income to spend on goods and services which are not necessary, but are more luxurious in nature.The concept is not new and has been part of society for long. This particular type of consumption is typically associated with the rich and wealthy and has only grown with time.The term 'Conspicuous consumption' was first coined by American economist Thorstein Veblen in his 1889 book, ""The Theory of the Leisure Class."" The theory is dynamic and has only evolved over the period of time with people searching for new ways of creating and displaying wealth.If we have to look at our society, there are many examples of conspicuous consumption. Designer clothes, expensive jewellery, luxury cars, etc. are some of examples which comes under forms of conspicuous consumption.If we look at above examples we will find that conspicuous consumers often buy those goods & services which are too expensive for other classes of society (social status). They buy these expensive items to show that they are a class above or to show their spending power.Advertising plays a major role in placing the product as a luxury item in the mind of consumers. The product has to be elegant, exclusive (branded bag, jewellery etc.), or tailor made for the consumer."
16,0,Copy Testing,"Definition: Copy-testing is a comprehensive approach used as part of marketing research to test the effectiveness of an advertisement based on responses prior to it being aired. This form of pre-testing will be beneficial for the company to understand whether an advertisement carries a strong-enough message.Description: Marketing activities are expensive and copy-testing can help you make sure that your campaign is effective. Before an advertisement is launched or aired there are series of tests which are done to gauge the effectiveness of the campaign. These tests are carried on even after the campaign is launched to measure the effectiveness.	Both qualitative and quantitative techniques are used to measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. The approach saves the company time and money as the ad will be error-free and include all the desired changes.	The main purpose of copy-testing is to fix ads which may not connect with the audience. If consumers are not able to connect with the ad, they might get a wrong message.	To overcome this challenge, companies often enroll marketing research firms to conduct these studies. The advertisement is shown to a small group of people to measure their response.	By conducting this experiment, the responses can be quantified to give the company a more meaningful feedback. Here, analysts can analyse real-time response from the respondents after watching the advertisement.	The analysis could be done around various things such as how respondents felt after watching the ad, their facial expression. A wider survey, post the ad, can provide more information about how they felt and their feedback.	Often changes are made when an ad is shown in different demographics to connect with the audience of that particular area. Copy testing also evaluates ad on demographics."
17,0,Cost Leadership,"Definition: Cost leadership is a term used when a company projects itself as the cheapest manufacturer or provider of a particular product or commodity in a competition. It is difficult to deploy the strategy because the management must constantly work on reducing cost at every level to remain competitive.Description: Cost leadership is a part of marketing strategy. Although, it is highly effective in gaining market share as well as drawing the customers' attention, it is difficult to deploy. The management team of the company has to constantly work towards reducing the cost of not just one product, but the entire range of products in the company's portfolio. Cost leadership does not mean that a company produces goods which are of inferior quality at comparatively cheap rates. That strategy will ultimately lead to failure. To deploy this strategy, a company has to produce goods which are of acceptable quality and specific to a set of customers at a price which is much lower or competitive than other companies producing the same product. The most famous cost leader in India is Big Bazaar, followed by Vishal Mega Mart."
18,0,Counter Advertising,"Definition: Counter advertising is an advertisement which responds to another advertisement. They are, at times parody of the original ad, but deliver a message. Counter advertising takes an opposing position or a counter-view, and is generally made out on controversial topics such as smoking or high sugar content in aerated drinks.Description: Counter advertising uses the same technique which caught your attention the first time when you saw the original ad, but tweaks it to deliver a different message to the audience.	It is an advertising technique which will catch your eye because you will identify with the message in the ad. For example, we all know the sugar content aerated drinks or sodas have.	With growing lifestyle diseases in the world, most people have become health conscious. And, because of that the consumption of soda has come down drastically. Consumers are looking for a drink, but without the added sugar content.	Many companies have come out with 'health flavoured water' which supposedly contains minimum amount of sugar and is filled with essential vitamins. On the face of it, the ad would be appealing, not because you are drinking flavoured water, but because it has less or minimal sugar content.	To create counter ads, one should analyse why the original ad was effective and use simple techniques to send across the message. When you are planning to create a counter ad, think of the one thing which you remember about the ad, was it the graphic or a sound or the message?	Visual images are a powerful tool in creating counter ad, this is because people often forget what they hear or what they read, but research shows that they are likely to remember what they see, for a long time."
19,0,Customer Lifetime Value,"Definition: Customer Lifetime Value or CLTV is the present value of the future cash flows or the value of business attributed to the customer during his or her entire relationship with the company.Description: CLTV is the value a customer contributes to your business over the entire lifetime at your company. It is a very important metric and is used while making important decisions about sales, marketing, product development, and customer support.	By applying Customer Lifetime Value marketing managers can easily arrive at the rupee value associated with the long-term relationship with any customer. It is difficult to predict how long each relationship will last, but marketing managers can make a good estimate and state CLTV as a periodic value.	It is useful metric used by marketing managers especially at a time of acquiring a customer. Ideally, lifetime value should be greater than the cost of acquiring a customer. Some also call it a break-even point.	The basic formula for calculating CLTV is the following (1):	 	(Average Order Value) x (Number of Repeat Sales) x (Average Retention Time) 	For example, let’s say you run a Health Club where customers pay Rs 1000 per month and the average time that a person remains a customer in your club is 3 years. Then the lifetime value of each customer is (according to the formula above):	Rs 1,000 per month x 12 months x 3 years = Rs 36,000. This means each customer is worth a lifetime value of Rs 36,000.	Once we calculate CLTV we know how much the company can spend on paid advertising such as Facebook ads, YouTube ads, Google Adwords etc. in order to acquire a new customer."
20,0,Distribution,"Definition: Distribution means to spread the product throughout the marketplace such that a large number of people can buy it.Distribution involves doing the following things:	1. A good transport system to take the goods into different geographical areas. 	2. A good tracking system so that the right goods reach at the right time in the right quantity. 	3. A good packaging, which takes the wear and tear of transport. 	4. Tracking the places where the product can be placed such that there is a maximum opportunity to buy it.	5. It also involves a system to take back goods from the trade. Description: Distribution can make or break a company. A good distribution system quite simply means the company has greater chance of selling its products more than its competitors. The company that spreads its products wider and faster into the market place at lower costs than its competitors will make greater margins absorb raw material price rise better and last longer in tough market conditions. Distribution is critical for any type of industry or service. The best price product, promotion and people come to nothing if the product is not available for sale at the points at which consumers can buy. 	In the FMCG industry in India, specially, companies distribute their low-value, high volume products to over 1 million retail outlets, or points of sale. The most successful FMCG companies have the biggest networks, made of factories, stock points, distributors or C&F (Carrying and forwarding agents), wholesalers, retailers and consumers. Nowadays, even direct marketing is considered a feasible distribution channel. "
21,0,Dog,"Definition: 'Dog' is named as one of the quadrants of the Boston Consultancy Group (BCG) matrix which has a small market share in a mature industry. The BCG growth share matrix was developed to manage different categories of business units in the company itself.Description: A 'dog' is a name given to a business unit within a company which has a much smaller share in a mature market. It does not generate a strong cash flow for the company and it does not need a large amount of investment to keep the unit running. The term can also be attributed to a stock which has been a marked underperformer compared to the benchmark indices for a longer period of time. In most cases we have seen that dog operates in a mature industry and if it is not bringing sustained cash flows, the management can selling a business unit and use the cash to invest in areas where returns are positive. If the company does not see a potential in the business unit which is referred to as dog, it will not allocate more cash to build the product to turn it into a Star or a Cash cow, both terms used in BCG matrix for different business units."
22,0,Double Blind Testing,"Definition: A double blind experiment is a procedure undertaken by a company to gather important data about its products. Here the subjects of the experiment or the persons who are conducting the experiment are not aware of who is in the control group.Description: Double blind testing is a scientific approach where the company plans to eliminate the experimental bias of the test subjects and the researchers.	 	These experiments are an important part of conducting research for a company to know more about the product they want to conduct their research on. Past research shows that people act differently when they are moderated or belong to a specific group.	For example, if a company wants to conduct a taste test experiment in which participants compare two popular coffee brands to figure out if their brand is stronger or not.	Now, if the individual who is moderating the test is also the employee of the company then there might be some conflict of interest as he/she would want his/her brand to score more and win the test.	This may further lead to things like giving test subjects further clues or adding more coffee to the drink just to make it stronger. All these things will lead to some amount of bias in the experiment which will not reflect the true purpose of the test.	For a company who is looking at concrete results, researchers use double blind experiment to remove both experimental and participational bias. These results are more widely accepted in conducting further research."
23,0,Early Adapters,"Definition: Early adapter is a person or a set of consumers who start using new technology or a product as soon as it is available in the market or gets launched. Companies rely heavily on early adapters to give valuable feedback about the product’s shortcomings or things which need improvement.Description: Early adapters pay more for a product as compared to another because of its exclusiveness. They buy the product as soon it is launched. Best in class features, exclusivity, brand names, and improved technology are some highlights of a product which induces such behaviour.	Research studies have shown that early adapters consist of 14-15 per cent of the buying population. Another reason why the company likes early adapters is that they provide word-of-mouth advertising.	They always want to stand apart from the crowd. This is seen with products such as mobile phones, luxury cars, eating joints or restaurants, etc. They play a very important role in the success of a newly-launched product.	Let’s understand the concept with the help of an example. When Google launched its flagship phone Nexus 6, it used a pre-booking system where only a fraction of the phones were were launched.	The product received tremendous response and was pre-booked by consumers who paid the full price. The phone was loaded with an operating system, features and an impressive battery life.	Going by the scenario, early adapters are willing to take risks because they are the first ones to use the technology. They play a key role in promoting the product to friends who show interest in the product.	Another example is when Apple launches its new iPhone. Long queues can be seen outside Apple stores on the launch date."
24,0,Endorsements,"Definition: Endorsements are a form of advertising that uses famous personalities or celebrities who command a high degree of recognition, trust, respect or awareness amongst the people. Such people advertise for a product lending their names or images to promote a product or service. Advertisers and clients hope such approval, or endorsement by a celebrity, will influence buyers favourably. For example, Sachin Tendulkar endorsing motorcycles and biscuits can influence young men or children who look to him as role model.Description: Such advertising connects with a lot more people than ordinary advertising can, because people will notice celebrities, famous personalities and role models even from a vast clutter of noise, people or products. Such ads work well for aspiration products or lifestyles. 	Endorsements can confer on a brand a larger-than-life image, and if the advertising follows the current celebrities and personalities, the endorsement can last quite long. Lux is an example, which is endorsed by all the leading actresses of the generation, helping greatly to keep Lux a relevant and attractive brand even as consumers change. 		The more famous or celebrated the endorser, the more expensive can it be to use that personality for a product. "
25,0,Focus Group,"Definition: A focus group is a small set of six to ten people who usually share common characteristics such as age, background, geography, etc.. The set comes together to discuss a predetermined topic. A focus group is a part of marketing research technique.Description: A focus group is useful in analysing a topic or getting an opinion on a predetermined topic for research. The information collected is used in making refinements to the product. With the help of focus groups, a company can collect information pertaining to what different groups or a set of people feel about a particular topic or a product. Feedback is collected from a set of people in case the company plans to change the appearance or the quality of a product and it wants to get the first reaction from different sets of people as to what they think, focus groups help the company to do just that. Based on the responses, the company can quickly analyse if people in the group like the refined product or not. They could also track the consumption patterns by asking them if they would increase the consumption once the refined product is introduced in the market. Focus groups can vary in size, depending on the issue, problem or the product that needs to be discussed. But, ideally it should be between 8-12 people."
26,0,Gantt Chart,"Definition: A Gantt chart is a useful graphical tool which shows activities or tasks performed against time. It is also known as visual presentation of a project where the activities are broken down and displayed on a chart which makes it is easy to understand and interpret.Description: A Gantt chart is a popular tool in project management. It basically drills down activities which need to be done by a fixed time period. It is commonly used for tracking project schedules.	On the chart, tasks are shown on the vertical axis while the scheduled time-spend is laid out on the horizontal axis. Each task is represented by a bar that shows the time required for the project.	The bar then represents or shows percentage of tasks that have been completed. It also shows dependencies, which simply means the interlinkages between various activities in the project.	Understanding the interlinkage between activities is very important to monitor and Gantt charts help the project manager to do just that. It conveys the information about the completion of other activities in the project. This information is important because of the interlinkages between various activities and if one activity gets delayed it will have an impact on others.	Gantt chart is a useful tool in planning and scheduling the projects. It keeps the management updated as to when the project will get completed. It also keeps the management informed about any additional resources that are required, and manage dependencies between tasks. 	They are commonly used in scheduling production processes, employee roster or scheduling, events scheduling, production processes, etc. Microsoft Excel can also be used to create Gantt charts apart from other independent software available in the market."
27,0,Gender Segmentation,"Definition: The categorization of potential markets on the basis of gender i.e. male or is what entailed in the process of ‘'Gender Segmentation'’. Though both males and females can come under the target market for a given product but it is also possible that the share of one gender may surpass the share of another gender in the company’s target market. With a view to cater the needs of both the genders, markets can be segregated by the businesses. Besides, markets can also bring changes in their products with an aim to fulfill the requirements of a specific gender thereby justifying the term Gender Segmentation.Description: Using various segmentation schemes, companies across the globe are able to target various customer groups effectively. Under gender segmentation, the database is divided into male or female. Both men and women have different interest in terms of shopping for various products such as apparel, cosmetics, perfumes, shoes etc. and even food habits. To overcome this challenge, a company should have different marketing strategy for both men and women. A woman will not buy a product which is made for a man. Likewise, a man would not purchase a product which is made for a woman. This particularly happens when we are shopping for perfumes. The segmentation based on the gender is important for lots of industries which have portfolios for both male as well as female. For example, Nike as a sportswear company has separate portfolio for both male as well as female. As a company, Nike will have to come out with different strategies to market products differently for male and female. The company even has to create a separate segment for both men and women in the showroom itself. This is much evident if you go to an apparel showroom such as Zara, Marks & Spencers etc. There are various benefits by deploying market segmentations. First, the company is able to target the niche market and expand its market base. The second is that it also leads to increase its competitiveness. Satisfied customers often lead to bring stability in the business. For example, if I wear shoes of a particular company for running, I will keep my trust intact with the same company when I am buying my second shoes because I am comfortable with the brand as well as the quality of the shoes."
28,0,Generic Strategies,"Definition: Michael Porter developed three generic strategies, that a company could use to gain competitive advantage, back in 1980. These three are: cost leadership, differentiation and focus. Description:  The cost leadership strategy advocates gaining competitive advantage due to the lowest cost of production of a product or service. Lowest cost need not mean lowest price. Costs are removed from every link of the value chain- including production, marketing, and wastages and so on. The product could still be priced at competitive parity (same prices as others), but because of the lower cost of production, the company would be able to sustain itself even through lean times and invest more into the business all throughout.	Examples are the TPS system developed by the Toyota Motor Company. The TPS system aims to cut costs throughout the company, but Toyota cars are still priced at almost the same levels as American or other Japanese cars. 	The 'differentiation' strategy involves creation of differentiated products for different segments. A variety of  products, each branded and promoted differently with levels of function, allows a company to 'desensitize' prices, and on the basis of being different, charge premium or higher prices. This strategy also provides a hedge against different markets and product life cycles, allowing cash flow to come in even if a few products decline, while others grow or mature.	A prime example of this strategy is Hindustan Lever, which, while focused on FMCG, has a range of products even within the soaps category for different segments. Such a strategy needs strong segmentation, marketing and branding skills. 	The 'focus' strategy involves focusing on a narrow, defined segment of the market, also called a 'niche' segment. For example, Porche markets to the particular segment that likes fast and expensive cars and can afford it. A company in a niche market has customers who understand, appreciate and can pay a premium for their indulgence. Competitive advantage - either by cost or differentiation- is created specially for the niche. But the risks are that the niche may not grow, or it may disappear with time and change. "
29,0,Impulsive Buying,"Definition: Impulsive buying is the tendency of a customer to buy goods and services without planning in advance. When a customer takes such buying decisions at the spur of the moment, it is usually triggered by emotions and feelings.Description: Impulsive buying can't be categorized for one specific product category. Impulsive buying can be seen in products such as chocolates, clothes, mobile phones and in big-ticket items such as cars, jewellery etc. Impulsive buying means making an unplanned purchase. It is based on an irrational thinking. Marketers try to tap this behavior of customers to boost sales. There is a great likelihood that customers end up making a purchase of products after entering the hypermarket without any actual intent of doing so. Many mobile phone-makers tend to exploit this trait in customers by introducing products which can be an add-on gadget for their mobiles such as fitness bands, watch etc."
30,0,Infomercial,"Definition: An infomercial is a form of advertisement which is aimed at educating the customer about a product or a series of products via television in the form of a program. Infomercial typically lasts longer than a regular advertisement and thus is more detailed.Description: Infomercials are good for those products which require detailed explanation about their features as they can run as a regular length television program. In the print media, infomercials appear as a separate supplement.	Infomercials are able to directly connect with its consumers on a real-time basis. They create that connect with the potential customer to make an enquiry about the product or place an order. Usually, various offers or promotions/discounts are pitched to customers at the time of product promotion.	A toll-free number is generally aired on the television channel as part of an infomercial with the product code to help customers order that particular product.	Another important feature of an infomercial is that it appears during off-peak hours, as compared to regular advertisements which appear during peak hours. One possible reason is that advertisement rates are generally lower around off-peak hours and because infomercials require more time, it comes out to be economical for them.	There is no defined category of products that use infomercials as part of their strategy to woo customers. Products ranging from clothes, cosmetics, sarees, home improvement, kitchen items, shoes, gym equipment, etc. use infomercial.	One of the major feature of infomercials is the reach and because of the way it is communicated, it makes an instant connect with consumers across regions. Most of the demand comes from tier II and tier III cities.	Homeshop 18 is one example which runs infomercials. It is a 24-hour television channel which only airs infomercials. Apart from that, it has some more shows which run on other channels such as Colors or Sony."
31,0,Innovation Adoption Curve,"Definition: The innovation adoption curve classifies the entry of users into various categories, based on their willingness to accept new technology or an idea. It is useful in breaking down or segregating consumers into five different segments or categories such as innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards.Description: The innovation adoption curve follows a bell-shaped curve, which can be divided into five different categories. Let's discuss each one of them in detail. Usually, the innovators are the first ones to adopt the new idea or the technology. They consist of a small percentage of the population, almost 2.5 per cent. They are the ones who are young and willing to take risks about the new technology.	The next ones are early adopters. Early adopters consist of almost 13.5 per cent. One characteristic which differentiates this group from the others is that they have a high degree of leadership or influencing power. They are also young individuals who are willing to take that extra risk.	The third category of individuals who adopt an innovation is Early Majority (34%). The only difference is that here the time of adoption is slightly longer, but the percentage is higher than innovators and early adopters. They have an above-average social status, and accept change more quickly than the average.	The fourth category of is Late Majority (34%). The individuals in this category take a lot of time to adopt new technology. They are the ones who will do research because they are sceptical of innovation. They adopt the new technology because of peer pressure.	Laggards is the fifty category of individuals who adopt an innovation. They are reluctant to any change. By the time laggards adopt the new technology it might have already become obsolete. They are fixated on past methods or technology for their daily usage."
32,0,Intensive Distribution,"Definition: Intensive distribution is a form of marketing strategy under which a company tries to sell its product from a small vendor to a big store. Virtually, a customer will be able to find the product everywhere he goes. Soft drinks and cigarettes are some of the examples on which intensive distribution is followed.Description: Under the intensive distribution strategy, all the possible outlets can be used by a company to distribute the product. It creates brand awareness of the product as well as boost sales. This method is particularly useful for products like soft drinks, cigarettes etc. There are various advantages of intensive distribution. First, it increases the supply of the product which raises the chances of more sales. More sales mean more revenues for the company. Another advantage is that a company is able to analyse the source of sale, whether a product is more in demand from local vendors or hypermarket type stores. With this data, the company can further plan out its promotional efforts to boost sales and increase the presence of the product. Looking at the data, a company can also analyse the causes of its failure in increasing its sales at some locations. In that case either it can cut down on the distribution or increase marketing efforts to build brand awareness."
33,0,Introduction Stage,"Definition: Introduction stage is the first stage in the product life cycle. The highlighting factor of this stage is that the product is new in the market, sales are slow and to push it higher the company has to incur heavy expenditure on advertisement to make it appealing to customers.Description: The introduction stage is the first stage in the product life cycle where a company tries to build awareness about the product or service in a market where there is less or no competition. Once the company makes adequate publicity about the product either by promotion or through branding, it can look at other aspects such as pricing, as well as distribution. Pricing a product in the introduction stage is very important to gain market share. A popular pricing strategy followed by most of the companies is the skimming price strategy. In this pricing strategy, a company usually charges a very high price to customers, who are willing to purchase a product. Price skimming is common especially when mobile phones are launched with new and improved features. Companies with established brand names make sure that the new product has some features which stand unique and the owner takes a pride in owning that mobile phone. Few examples of unique features are: mobile charging, finger print scanner to unlock a phone, etc. Even flash sales that companies adopt for launching a product have high prices. For example, when Google launched its Nexus series 6, it launched this mobile through e-shopping platform with a price tag of Rs 44,000. The phone had the state-of-the-art specs which supported the high price tag."
34,0,Involvement,"Definition: Involvement or employee involvement can be defined as creating an environment in which an employee participates more in the day-to-day decision-making which leads to a better relationship with the manager. More direct participation by employees helps the organization to achieve its goals rapidly and effortlessly.Description: Employee involvement is not any quantitative tool or a goal of an organisation, it is more of a leadership tool or a thought which usually percolates from the top. This culture can only be adopted if senior managers are satisfied with more employees' participation in the day-to-day working of the company. For effective working, organisations should involve more and more people in some kind of decision-making or planning of activities. More involvement brings a sense of accomplishment in the minds of employees as well as increase their commitment level towards the organisation. The idea behind this concept is that employees who are already aligned with a set of work know what is best for the process or department they are working for. By engaging employees more, a firm shows that it values its employees, in turn it leads to a better commitment level from employees. Involving employees more would also lead to the dissemination of better ideas, which will result in higher productivity and better quality."
35,0,Lifestyle Segmentation,"Definition: Customer lifestyle segmentation is a practice which involves dividing the information of each and every customer into small sub-groups. These sub-groups are made from the data pertaining to each and every customer. These groups are created to draw inferences about customer choices, likes or dislikes.Definition: Customer lifestyle segmentation is a part of marketing management technique in which small sub-groups are created from the data according to their choices, needs, likes and dislikes. This data can actually help the company in pitching across different similar products to the customers in an effort to increase the market share. When a company or a brand team approaches a customer who is already using a similar product, s/he is more likely to buy a product if it is pitched properly. This can only happen if the company knows what the customer was using previously. 	Customer lifestyle segmentation data can help the marketing team to understand the customer properly in terms of his needs, choices as well as his taste for new products. Some customers are reluctant to change their product preference category, while few are more eager to buy a new product if introduced within a similar price range. The ones who are more flexible in buying new products are prospective buyers of the product or services, which the company is planning to make a pitch for, to the new customers."
36,0,Loss Leaders,"Definition: Loss leaders are high volume, high profile brands or products that are sold by retailers with the intention to attract customers into their premises, with the hope that those customers will end up buying other goods as well, once inside. Examples could be steeply discounted electronics, or consumer goods, or garments. A zero percent loan for cars is a loss leader example for the dealer. Description: Loss leader brands or products are sold at very slim margins or at a loss, with the conscious understanding that other products in the retail outlet will make up for the loss. A mix of loss leader pricing and usual pricing could make up the overall margins. Loss leaders can be used by smaller retailers against the giant national chains to maintain their market share. It can also be used as a price segmentation tool. "
37,0,Market Challenger,"Definition: A market challenger is a company which tries to expand its market share by aggressively flooding the market with its products at competitive prices. A market challenger is a firm or a company which is usually at the No.2 or No.3 position.Description: A market challenger is a firm which is just below the market leader with a good presence. The basic aim of the market challenger is to expand its market share and become the industry leader by introducing a new variety of products or by improving customer service etc. Companies with low market share usually try and adopt this strategy to increase their market share. They can challenge the market leader or other competitors by launching these strategies. When a brand enters a market, it is not necessary that the market leader is its competitor. Even companies which are at 2nd or the 4th position may turn out to be competiton as they may be eating into the market share.	How can a brand stop that?	1) Use of frontal attack	2) Flank Attack	3) Encirclement attack	4 Bypass attack and	5) Guerrilla marketing	A market challenger can deploy a full-frontal attack by introducing products similar to that of the market leader with similar quality, competitive pricing, aggressive advertisement and distribution process. The best strategy to gain market share is to introduce differentiated products which will help in creating their own brand name and push that product aggressively into the market with different distribution channels. Whatever strategy a firm adopts to gain market share or tries to bring down the market leader, requires a huge sum of money. To become a market challenger is a costly process and firms should be well aware of the same."
38,0,Market Concentration,"Definition: Market concentration is used when smaller firms account for large percentage of the total market. It measures the extent of domination of sales by one or more firms in a particular market. The market concentration ratio is measured by the concentration ratio.Description: The market concentration ratio measures the combined market share of all the top firms in the industry. ‘Market Share’ is used as a reference here in the formulae. It could be sales, employment statistics, number of people using a company’s services, number of outlets etc. The value of top firms or top ‘n’ firms may be three or maximum five. If the top firms keep on gaining market share, then we say that the industry has become highly concentrated. To understand market concentration, let’s first understand ‘concentration’. Concentration within an industry can be defined as the degree at which a small number of firms make up for the total production in the market. If the concentration is low, it simply means that top ‘n’ firms are not influencing the market production and the industry is considered to be highly competitive. On the other hand, if the concentration is high, it means that top ‘n’ firms influence the production or services provided in the market the industry then is said to be oligopolistic or monopolistic. 	The most common measure to calculate the market concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). This index is calculated by adding the square root of the percentage market share of each individual firm in the industry. For example in a market consisting of only five firms with shares of 30%, 30%, 20%,20% and 20%, the Herfindahl Index would be 3000 (900 + 900+ 400+ 400+400). The index may rise as high as 10,000 if the market has a monopoly. But, lower the index is, more competitive the market becomes. The indicator could become zero for the perfect competition."
39,0,Market Development,"Definition: Market development is a strategic step taken by a company to develop the existing market rather than looking for a new market. The company looks for new buyers to pitch the product to a different segment of consumers in an effort to increase sales.Description: Market Development is a 2-step process to tap the untapped market. It begins with market research wherein a company does a segmentation analysis and short ists market segments which are worth pursuing. It is an attempt to use the existing product or service to attract new customers. The goal is to expand the reach or tap into a different segment or unexplored market. A segment is defined as the small sub-group of a larger population. For example, the marketing team of the company can divide the market based on geography, demographics as well as income levels etc. Once the company decides which segment to choose, the next step of market development involves creating a promotional strategy to enter into the market. For that, companies may have to take the support of both audio and visual media to push the product deeper into the market. 	Another aspect is the pricing of the product. If there are competitors in the market, you may have to price the product accordingly or come out with a product which belongs to the same segment but differs in features, quality etc. to command higher pricing. To counter competition, the marketing team could look at the penetration pricing where you can aggressively price the product below competitors product to gain market share. The major challenge faced by firms, which want to indulge in market development, is that it is a costly affair. It requires huge capital investment to keep the project going. If the investment in the new segment doesn’t pay off as desired, then the whole exercise turns out to be worthless."
40,0,Marketing Intelligence,"Definition: Marketing intelligence is the external data collected by a company about a specific market which it wishes to enter, to make decisions. It is the first set of data which the company analyses before making any investment decision.Description: Marketing intelligence is usually the first data set analysed by a company about a specific market. It could be related to population age in that area, infrastructure facilities, spending habits of consumers, state or government regulations etc. Marketing intelligence is all about gathering information on various data sets, analysing the information, breaking down the data into small subsets and the distribution of information to the relevant department of the company. 	A purchase department in a company would need a different data set under marketing intelligence, while a sales department would need something different. There are four main corner stones of marketing intelligence. The first one is competitor intelligence, the others are product intelligence, market understanding and customer understanding. Let’s understand each one of them in detail. Competitor intelligence is a legal method of obtaining information about products in a competitor’s portfolio. It is about analyzing strengths and weaknesses of the competitor. 	The basic goal of competitive intelligence is to make better business decisions. Product Intelligence is related to gathering information about your own product. The focus around product intelligence is on gathering information about the quality and performance of the product. This is usually an automated process. With the help of this knowledge, the company tries and makes the user experience better or makes changes in the product itself to make it safer or add new features. Market Understanding is a concept wherein the company tries to understand the performance of the product in which it is already operating as well as looks at other markets where it wants to launch its product thoroughly.	Finally, understanding the customer is the utmost important aspect in the life of any product. It is key to the success of the product pre- and post-sales."
41,0,Marketing Mix,"Definition: The marketing mix refers to the set of actions, or tactics, that a company uses to promote its brand or product in the market. The 4Ps make up a typical marketing mix - Price, Product, Promotion and Place. However, nowadays, the marketing mix increasingly includes several other Ps like Packaging, Positioning, People and even Politics as vital mix elements.Description: What are the 4Ps of marketing?Price: refers to the value that is put for a product. It depends on costs of production, segment targeted, ability of the market to pay, supply - demand and a host of other direct and indirect factors. There can be several types of pricing strategies, each tied in with an overall business plan. Pricing can also be used a demarcation, to differentiate and enhance the image of a product.Product: refers to the item actually being sold. The product must deliver a minimum level of performance; otherwise even the best work on the other elements of the marketing mix won't do any good.Place: refers to the point of sale. In every industry, catching the eye of the consumer and making it easy for her to buy it is the main aim of a good distribution or 'place' strategy. Retailers pay a premium for the right location. In fact, the mantra of a successful retail business is 'location, location, location'.Promotion: this refers to all the activities undertaken to make the product or service known to the user and trade. This can include advertising, word of mouth, press reports, incentives, commissions and awards to the trade. It can also include consumer schemes, direct marketing, contests and prizes.What is the importance of the marketing mix? All the elements of the marketing mix influence each other. They make up the business plan for a company and handled right, can give it great success. But handled wrong and the business could take years to recover. The marketing mix needs a lot of understanding, market research and consultation with several people, from users to trade to manufacturing and several others.How does Marketing Mix help your business?

42,0,Market Leader,"Definition: A market leader could be a product, brand, company, organisation, group name which has the highest percentage of total sales revenue of a particular market. Market leader dominates the market by influencing the customer loyalty towards it, distribution, pricing, etc.Description: Market leader can be attributed to a firm which has the largest market share in a given industry. The term could also be ascribed to a firm which has the highest profitability margin as well. The market share is calculated by dividing the volume of goods sold by a particular firm by the total number of units in the market. Market leadership as a concept holds much relevance in the internet age because over a period of time we have seen large number of companies becoming market leaders. 	Market leader often enjoys the first -mover advantage in new markets. Let’s look at some examples of market leaders in the digital space. Microsoft was the first company to launch operating system (Windows) and web browser (Internet Explorer) in the market. Apple as a company was the first one to introduce the concept of portable media device in which music can be stored on a drive, ipod. Market leadership is not about sales and dominance but it is more about how relevant the product is for the audience. Apple generates more revenue by selling iPods compared to other manufacturers who are selling MP3 players. It is all about innovative ideas which will help the company to connect with the relevant audience. The company tries to introduce those products in the market which can add value to the customer. Market leaders often unveil products which can redefine the customer experience in terms of product quality, longevity, ease of operating that product etc."
43,0,Markets,"Definition: A market is defined as the sum total of all the buyers and sellers in the area or region under consideration. The area may be the earth, or countries, regions, states, or cities.The value, cost and price of items traded are as per forces of supply and demand in a market. The market may be a physical entity, or may be virtual. It may be local or global, perfect and imperfect.Description: What are the different types of markets?A market can be called the 'available market' - that of all the people in the area. Within the available market, there is the 'market minimum'- or the market size, which will buy goods without any marketing effort. This is the lowest sale that a company could get without any action on its part. In today's world, this level is sinking ever lower.There is also the 'market potential', which is the maximum market size that will buy goods when subjected to the greatest marketing action that a company can do. Beyond this market potential, the costs outweigh the gains. The market potential is therefore the upper limit for a marketplace and sales."
44,0,Market Share,"Definition: Out of total purchases of a customer of a product or service, what percentage goes to a company defines its market share. In other words, if consumers as a whole buy 100 soaps, and 40 of which are from one company, that company holds 40% market share. Description: There are various types of market share. Market shares can be value or volume. Value market share is based on the total share of a company out of total segment sales. Volumes refer to the actual numbers of units that a company sells out of total units sold in the market. The value-volume market share equation is not usually linear: a unit may have high value and low numbers, which means that value market share may be high, but volumes share may be low. In industries like FMCG, where the products are low value, high volume and there are lots of freebies, comparing value market share is the norm.	The significance of market share: Market share is a measure of the consumers' preference for a product over other similar products. A higher market share usually means greater sales, lesser effort to sell more and a strong barrier to entry for other competitors. A higher market share also means that if the market expands, the leader gains more than the others. By the same token, a market leader - as defined by its market share - also has to expand the market, for its own growth. 	How much market share is enough? Usually, gaining 100% market share is not a good idea, as the risk associated with market actions, like fashion changes, product / use changes will impact the company heavily. Also, the cost and effort to maintain 100% market share against nimble, local or more aggressive smaller competitors can be very high and killing. Most companies decide on a target market share beyond which the cost of acquiring marketshare is more than the profit from that incremental gain."
45,0,Mark Up,"Definition: Mark up refers to the value that a player adds to the cost price of a product. The value added is called the mark-up. The mark-up added to the cost price usually equals retail price.For example, a FMCG company sells a bar of soap to the retailer at Rs 10. This is the cost price. The retailer adds Rs 2 as his value and sells the soap to the final consumer at Rs 10. The margin of Rs 2 between the cost price and MRP is the mark-up. In this case, the mark up on the cost price is (2/8= 25%) and on the MRP is 2/10 = 20%.Markup refers to the cost; margins to the price.Description: In the example, what is the significance of mark up? The amount of markup allowed to the retailer determines the money he makes from selling every unit of the product.Higher the markup, greater the cost to the consumer, and greater the money the retailer makes. In FMCG, typically, the MRP is low and the retailer is allowed a lower markup, from anywhere between 5 and 8%. Low margins means a retailer makes less money on every unit, but the number of units sold is very high in FMCG. So overall, the amount of money made evens out.The price that the market can bear usually determines the selling price, or in India, the Maximum Retail Price (MRP). Companies work backwards and after accounting for production and marketing costs, arrive at values for the players in the FMCG industry- the transport, distributors and retailers.Strength in the market place also determines the markup and margins allowed. A well-established FMCG company like Hindustan Lever can give less margins to the retailers because the volume of sales of its wide range of products is very high. On the other hand, a new and unknown product and company will need to pay more margins to the retailers to entice them to stock the product in the first place."
46,0,Minimum Viable Product,"Definition: Minimum Viable Product or MVP is a development technique in which a new product is introduced in the market with basic features, but enough to get the attention of the consumers. The final product is released in the market only after getting sufficient feedback from the product's initial users.Description: Minimum Viable Product or MVP is the most basic version of the product which the company wants to launch in the market. It could be a car, website, TV, or a laptop. By introducing the basic version to the consumers, companies want to gauge the response from prospective consumers or buyers.	This technique helps them in making the final product much better. With the help of MVP concept, the research or the marketing team will come to know where the product is lacking and or what are its strengths or weaknesses.	MVP has three distinct features. One is that it will have enough features for consumers to purchase the product (it becomes easier for the company to market it), the other is that it will have some sort of a feedback mechanism wherein users would be able to send their feedback about the product. And, lastly it should have enough future benefits for consumers who to adopt the product first (Google gave free upgrade of its OS to all Nexus users).	The idea is to get feedback from the consumers which will in turn help in making the desired changes in the final product. MVP actually tests the usage scenario rather that is much for more helpful for the company to make changes to the final product.	Let's understand the concept with the help of an example. MVP is a popular concept in the online space, where a website is launched with basic features to find out how consumers respond to the product displayed on the website.	It could be a consumable product, daily use product or even a service provided by a website provider. The idea is to start small and then take cues from the users as to what exactly are they expecting from the product.	Some of the noted examples are Dropbox, Groupon, Zappos, etc."
47,0,Niche Marketing,"Definition: Niche marketing is defined as channeling all marketing efforts towards one well-defined segment of the population. There is one important thing to understand that ‘niche’ does not exist, but is created by smart marketing techniques and identifying what the customer wants.Description: Niche marketing is a marketing tactic deployed to target a specific market segment which is unique. Niche market is often created by identifying what a customer wants and this can be done if the company knows what the customer needs and then tries to deliver a better solution to a problem which was not presented by other firms. A niche market does not mean a small market, but it involves specific target audience with a specialized offering. By doing so, the company becomes a market leader and it becomes possible for other firms to enter that particular segment. For example, there are various cinema halls across India, but there are few which have recliner seats to offer. Not everybody wants to watch a movie by paying 5x-6x times the cost of a normal ticket. Hence, the target audience is very different and the hall is also only open at places where the company feels that it would be able to tap into target audience especially in posh areas. 	There are various advantages of niche marketing. One of the benefits of niche market is that there is no or little competition under that segment. The company is virtually the market leader and enjoys price monopoly. The another benefit is the strong relationship with the customers because of the fact that the company operates in a small segment, the relationship between the company and the brand becomes stronger which is also a key to customer loyalty. Niche businesses are often high margin business. Customers do not mind paying a little extra because, they are only able to get that service in that company or under its brand."
48,0,Penetration,"Definition: Penetration defines how many users are there for a product. It is one of the measures of a company or industry's success in getting consumers to use their products. The penetration numbers for India are very low in most products, like telephones (tele density) or shampoos, soaps, cosmetics and so on. Description: A rising penetration of products in the country signifies a greater consumer class, willing to use products. Rising penetration should translate into rising market share for the leader as well. Low penetration numbers are usually quoted in India's context to show what potential exists in the Indian market place. 	Penetration of a product depends on several factors, like income, marketing activity, needs, positioning, logistics of making the product available in the first place, demographics as well as an understanding of consumer needs.	For example, shampoo's penetration in India is still low in rural areas as people there use soap for hair washing, and not so much shampoo.	FMCG marketers found that selling low unit cost, single use sachets to rural markets encouraged price-sensitive rural people to try shampoo. The sachet has since then been one of the greatest causes of increasing shampoo, soap and all other types of products into rural markets. "
49,0,Perceived Value Pricing,"Definition: Perceived value pricing is that value which customers are willing to pay for a particular product or service based on their perception about the product. Perceived value pricing is not based on the cost of the product, but it is the value which the customer thinks that he/she is deriving from consuming a product or a service.Description: Perceived value pricing is an important marketing strategy which helps firms to price a particular product in the markets. Generally, marketers position the product in such a way that it will make the product unique.	Customers usually compare the value that they derive after using the product or service and end up paying more. Marketers need to show the customers the true value they would get after using the product.	Let's understand perceived value pricing with the help of some examples: If you have to reach the airport you have multiple options given by the cab rental company. They will give you a choice between multiple car segments for the same destination.	Usually, prices are higher for a sedan, a sports utility vehicle or a multi-purpose vehicle, as compared to a hatchback. Although, the distance remains the same, but customers pay a higher value per kilometre for higher category of cars.	The comparison that customers can draw is that sedan vehicles are more spacious, cleaner, more comfortable, and there is space for more passengers as compared to a hatchback.	Another example is luxury watches. The production cost is usually low even if it is studded with diamonds. But, some watch companies usually sell their products for over Rs 1 lakh.	Here the customers are not concerned about the cost of the product, but pay for the brand (it might be associated with a celebrity), the experience, and how it will add to the social status of the person."
50,0,Personal Selling,"Definition: Personal selling is also known as face-to-face selling in which one person who is the salesman tries to convince the customer in buying a product. It is a promotional method by which the salesperson uses his or her skills and abilities in an attempt to make a sale.Description: Personal selling is a face-to-face selling technique by which a salesperson uses his or her interpersonal skills to persuade a customer in buying a particular product. The salesperson tries to highlight various features of the product to convince the customer that it will only add value. However, getting a customer to buy a product is not the motive behind personal selling every time. Often companies try to follow this approach with customers to make them aware of a new product.	The company wants to spread awareness about the product for which it adopts a person-to-person approach. This is because selling involves personal touch, a salesperson knows better how to pitch a product to the potential customer. Personal selling can take place through two different channels – through retail and through direct-to-consumer channel. Under the retail channel, a sales person interacts with potential customers who come on their own to enquire about a product. The job of the salesperson is to make sure that he understands the need of the customers and accordingly shows various products that he keeps under that category. Under the direct channel, a salesperson visits potential customers in an attempt to make them aware about a new product that the company is launching or it may have a new offer which the customers may not get from the open market."
51,0,Pest Analysis,"Definition: PEST Analysis is a measurement tool which is used to assess markets for a particular product or a business at a given time frame. PEST stands for Political, Economic, Social, and Technological factors. Once these factors are analysed organisations can take better business decisions.Description: PEST Analysis helps organizations take better business decisions and improve efficiency by studying various factors which might influence a business such as political, economic, social, and technology.	PEST analysis helps in making strategic business decisions, planning marketing activities, product development and research. It is similar to SWOT analysis, which stands for Strength, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats.	Let's study each individual factor of PEST analysis in detail. In PEST analysis, 'P' stands for Political environment. It includes government regulations or any defined rules for that particular industry or business. It also involves study of tax policy which includes exemptions if any, employment laws, environment laws, etc.	The letter 'E' in PEST analysis stands for economic factors. It gauges the economic environment by studying factors in the macro economy such as interest rates, economic growth, exchange rate as well as inflation rate. These factors also help in accessing the demand, costing of the product, expansion, and growth.	'S' stands for social factors that form the macro environment of the organisation. It includes the study of demographics, as well as the target customers. These factors help in gauging the potential size of the market. It includes study of population growth, age distribution, career attitude, etc. 	The letter 'T' in PEST analysis stands for technology. As we all know, technology changes very rapidly, and consumers are hungry to adopt new technology. It involves understanding factors which are related to technological advancements, rate at which technology gets obsolete (Example: the operating system in mobile phones), automation, and innovation."
52,0,Place,"Definition: Place in the marketing mix refers to the channel, or the route, through which goods move from the source to the final user. Place could be the intermediaries, distributors, wholesalers and retailers. Description: The right place means greater chances of sales over a longer period of time. This translates into greater market share, more profits and better ability to track the changes in the marketplace in thinking, styles, fashion and needs. 	What players make up the 'place' aspect of the marketing mix? Retailers, wholesalers, distributors, warehouses and even the Internet make up the 'place' aspect of the marketing mix. All of these move, stock and sell goods. Retailers may brand themselves, and in fact, some of the largest companies in the world are retailers like Wal- Mart. 		As retailers consolidate and become bigger in the channel, their power for margins and goods also grows. "
53,0,Positioning,"Definition: Positioning defines where your product (item or service) stands in relation to others offering similar products and services in the marketplace as well as the mind of the consumer. Description: A good positioning makes a product unique and makes the users consider using it as a distinct benefit to them. A good position gives the product a USP (Unique selling proposition). In a market place cluttered with lots of products and brands offering similar benefits, a good positioning makes a brand or product stand out from the rest, confers it the ability to charge a higher price and stave off competition from the others. A good position in the market also allows a product and its company to ride out bad times more easily. A good position is also one which allows flexibility to the brand or product in extensions, changes, distribution and advertising. "
54,0,Pre-emptive Pricing,"Definition: Preemptive pricing is a methodology of selling a product at a price which is below the normal or market price for a short period of time to boost sales, beat competition or bring awareness in consumers. Besides, it also hinders new firms from entering that particular segment.Description: Price is the amount of money which a company charges from a customer. Preemptive pricing is usually a price which is slightly less than the normal prices observed in the industry of a particular product or a service. In an attempt to boost sales, some companies even try and set the price which is even below the manufacturing price of that product. It helps the company in several ways. First, it helps a company in penetrating into the market. Secondly, it helps a company to tackle the competition by pricing the product at a slightly less price than that of its competitors. This type of strategy is viable in a market which has fewer barriers during entry. 	When a company deploys this pricing strategy, it is conscious that it will only increase awareness and not the revenue. Hence, it should be confident about the appropriate time of deploying this strategy. Mobile phone operators generally use this strategy to expand their market share. They reduce the price of the product considerably or come out with easy finance schemes to boost their share and increase the market share of the product as well."
55,0,Pricing Options,"Definition: Apart from the four basic pricing strategies -- premium, skimming, economy or value and penetration -- there can be several other variations on these. Description:What is psychological pricing? 	A price of Rs 9.95 is a psychological price, such that the customer feels he hasn't paid Rs 10, which may sound high, but less than that. At the end of the day, the customer still pays Rs 10, since India doesn't have 5 paise coins, but this price addresses the emotional rather than the rational side of the customer. Bata has been using this pricing for several years for its shoes. What is product line pricing? 	When there are several items in a product line, buying a series of them as a package could be cheaper than buying each separately. For example, Lux soap, Lux skincare and Lux shampoo; buy them in one set, it'll be cheaper than buying individually. What is Captive pricing? 	In this strategy, the manufacturer will price the product low, but the consumables in it will be high since by that time the customer is used to the product. So, initial capital outlay may be low but working capital needed could be high. Blades are an example. While the razor may be cheap, the twin blade or Mach 3 blades are not. What is bundled pricing? 	Selling VCDs with Disc players is bundling two products for a price lower than individually. Other examples are in FMCG, buy mosquito mats, get the machine also at lower cost. This pricing can also remove old stock.What is geographical pricing? 	Prices vary as per location of the sale, taking into account logistics, costs, or even the ability of the market to pay."
56,0,Pricing Strategies,"Definition: Price is the value that is put to a product or service and is the result of a complex set of calculations, research and understanding and risk taking ability. A pricing strategy takes into account segments, ability to pay, market conditions, competitor actions, trade margins and input costs, amongst others. It is targeted at the defined customers and against competitors. Description: There are several pricing strategies: Premium pricing: high price is used as a defining criterion. Such pricing strategies work in segments and industries where a strong competitive advantage exists for the company. Example: Porche in cars and Gillette in blades. Penetration pricing: price is set artificially low to gain market share quickly. This is done when a new product is being launched. It is understood that prices will be raised once the promotion period is over and market share objectives are achieved. Example: Mobile phone rates in India; housing loans etc. Economy pricing: no-frills price. Margins are wafer thin; overheads like marketing and advertising costs are very low. Targets the mass market and high market share. Example: Friendly wash detergents; Nirma; local tea producers. Skimming strategy: high price is charged for a product till such time as competitors allow after which prices can be dropped. The idea is to recover maximum money before the product or segment attracts more competitors who will lower profits for all concerned. Example: the earliest prices for mobile phones, VCRs and other electronic items where a few players ruled attracted lower cost Asian players. 	These are the four basic strategies, variations of which are used in the industry."
57,0,Product,"Definition: A product is the item offered for sale. A product can be a service or an item. It can be physical or in virtual or cyber form. Every product is made at a cost and each is sold at a price. The price that can be charged depends on the market, the quality, the marketing and the segment that is targeted. Each product has a useful life after which it needs replacement, and a life cycle after which it has to be re-invented. In FMCG parlance, a brand can be revamped, re-launched or extended to make it more relevant to the segment and times, often keeping the product almost the same.Description: A product needs to be relevant: the users must have an immediate use for it. A product needs to be functionally able to do what it is supposed to, and do it with a good quality.A product needs to be communicated: Users and potential users must know why they need to use it, what benefits they can derive from it, and what it does difference it does to their lives. Advertising and 'brand building' best do this.A product needs a name: a name that people remember and relate to. A product with a name becomes a brand. It helps it stand out from the clutter of products and names.A product should be adaptable: with trends, time and change in segments, the product should lend itself to adaptation to make it more relevant and maintain its revenue stream.Know more about Product: Watch video..."
58,0,Product Life Cycle,"Definition: Product life cycle (PLC) is the cycle through which every product goes through from introduction to withdrawal or eventual demise. Description: These stages are:Introduction: When the product is brought into the market. In this stage, there's heavy marketing activity, product promotion and the product is put into limited outlets in a few channels for distribution. Sales take off slowly in this stage. The need is to create awareness, not profits. 	The second stage is growth. In this stage, sales take off, the market knows of the product; other companies are attracted, profits begin to come in and market shares stabilize. 	The third stage is maturity, where sales grow at slowing rates and finally stabilize. In this stage, products get differentiated, price wars and sales promotion become common and a few weaker players exit. 	The fourth stage is decline. Here, sales drop, as consumers may have changed, the product is no longer relevant or useful. Price wars continue, several products are withdrawn and cost control becomes the way out for most products in this stage. Significance of PLC: PLC analysis, if done properly, can alert a company as to the health of the product in relation to the market it serves. PLC also forces a continuous scan of the market and allows the company to take corrective action faster. But the process is rarely easy."
59,0,Promotions,"Definition: Promotions refer to the entire set of activities, which communicate the product, brand or service to the user. The idea is to make people aware, attract and induce to buy the product, in preference over others. Description: There are several types of promotions. Above the line promotions include advertising, press releases, consumer 	promotions (schemes, discounts, contests), while below the line include trade discounts, freebies, incentive trips, awards and so on. Sales promotion is a part of the overall promotion effort. 	There are also: 	1. Personal selling: one of the most effective ways of customer relationship. Such selling works best when a good working relationship has been built up over a period of time. 		This can also be expensive and time consuming, but is best for high value or premium products. 2. Sales promotions: this includes freebies, contests, discounts, free services, passes, tickets and so on, as distinct from advertising, publicity and public relations. 3. Public relations: PR is the deliberate, planned and sustained effort to establish and maintain mutual understanding between the company and the public."
60,0,Quota Sampling,"Definition: Quota sampling is a sampling methodology wherein data is collected from a homogeneous group. It involves a two-step process where two variables can be used to filter information from the population. It can easily be administered and helps in quick comparison.Description: Quota sampling is a simple yet effective way to do research in the initial phases. From the population, the researcher could select two variables to study about a particular group. He could use gender as well as income level or the education level for the purpose of research. The researcher could also add other sub-points to the data set according to the requirements of the research. 	In a quota sampling there is a non-random sample selection taken, but it is done from one category which some researchers feel could be unreliable. The researchers run the risk of bias. Interviewers might be tempted to interview those individuals on the street who appear most helpful in filling the form or they could sample individuals who could contradict them or others known to them just to meet the target set of audience. 	Quota sampling is used when the company is short of time or the budget of the person who is researching on the topic is limited. Quota sampling can also be used at times when detailed accuracy is not important. To create a quota sample, knowledge about the population and the objective should be well understood so that the researcher can choose the relevant stratification; next is to calculate quota from each section of the population and at the end keep on adding samples until the quota for each section is met. 	Quota sampling has its own advantages. It is an easy process to carry out and decipher information once the sampling is done. It also improves the representation of any particular group within the population thereby ensuring that these groups are not over-represented."
61,0,Random Sampling,"Definition: Random sampling is a part of the sampling technique in which each sample has an equal probability of being chosen. A sample chosen randomly is meant to be an unbiased representation of the total population. If for some reasons, the sample does not represent the population, the variation is called a sampling error.Description: Random sampling is one of the simplest forms of collecting data from the total population. Under random sampling, each member of the subset carries an equal opportunity of being chosen as a part of the sampling process. For example, the total workforce in organisations is 300 and to conduct a survey, a sample group of 30 employees is selected to do the survey. In this case, the population is the total number of employees in the company and the sample group of 30 employees is the sample. Each member of the workforce has an equal opportunity of being chosen because all the employees which were chosen to be part of the survey were selected randomly. But, there is always a possibility that the group or the sample does not represent the population as a whole, in that case, any random variation is termed as a sampling error. 	An unbiased random sample is important for drawing conclusions. For example when we took out the sample of 30 employees from the total population of 300 employees, there is always a possibility that a researcher might end up picking over 25 men even if the population consists of 200 men and 100 women. Hence, some variations when drawing results can come up, which is known as a sampling error. One of the disadvantages of random sampling is the fact that it requires a complete list of population. For example, if a company wants to carry out a survey and intends to deploy random sampling, in that case, there should be total number of employees and there is a possibility that all the employees are spread across different regions which make the process of survey little difficult."
62,0,Rebranding,"Definition: Rebranding is the process of changing the corporate image of an organisation. It is a market strategy of giving a new name, symbol, or change in design for an already-established brand. The idea behind rebranding is to create a different identity for a brand, from its competitors, in the market.Description: There are several reasons for a company to go for rebranding. One prominent factor is to connect with customers. Rebranding is good for the business, but at the same time it may be risky. There is always a possibility that the consumers do not like the new brand.	There are two types of rebranding: one is Proactive rebranding and the other is Reactive rebranding. Proactive rebranding is done when a company recognises that there is an opportunity to grow, innovate, tap into new businesses or customers, and to reconnect with its users.	Let’s understand with the help of an example – Titan Industries rebranded itself in 2013 and changed the logo as well as the name to Titan Company. The new logo highlighted the company’s commitment to ""create value, innovate, and maintain highest global standards"".	Reactive rebranding is done in a situation when the existing brand has be discontinued or changed. Possible reasons for such a action could be mergers & acquisitions, legal issues, negative publicity such as fraud, aiming to beat the competition, or create your own niche.	Let’s understand with the help of an example. Following the revelation of 2009 fraud, Satyam Computer Service was pushed to the brink of bankruptcy. The company was sold to Tech Mahindra. The whole process was overlooked by government authorities and Tech Mahindra then rebranded the company as ‘Mahindra Satyam’ and in the year 2013, it merged itself with Satyam Computer Services."
63,0,Reference Price,"Definition: Reference price is also known as competitive pricing, because here the product is sold just below the price of a competitor’s product. Reference price is the cost at which a manufacturer or a store owner sells a particular product, giving a hefty discount compared to its previously advertised price.Description: Reference pricing, in simple terms, is known as that price which users compare with the price of a competitor’s product or the previously advertised price. Here the price of the product, which is more expensive, becomes the reference price for your product.	Marketers generally induce buying behaviour in customers by putting goods and services at a huge discount compared to its original price. Human beings tend to compare the price of the product with the reference price, and if the new price is heavily discounted compared to the original price, it could trigger buying.	Reference pricing is also part of psychological pricing, because it is the price of the product which buyers use as a reference while making a decision to buy the product. Usually reference price is also mentioned on the product so that consumers can compare the difference in rupee value terms.	Let's understand reference price with the help of some examples. Big Bazaar, India's leading supermarket store, conducts a sale around Independence Day every year. Here the price is discounted heavily which leads to an increased sales volume.	They also extend discounts to electronics like camera and mobile phones. The idea is to generate sales in that particular time frame. The consumers usually see the difference between discounted price and the original price or the reference price.	Online shopping portals such as Flipkart and Amazon also run their big billion days or festive sales on particular days, where products are sold at a hefty discount."
64,0,Return On Marketing Investment,"Definition: Return on marketing investment or ROMI is a metric used in online marketing to measure the effectiveness of a marketing campaign. It examines results in relation to the specific marketing objective. ROMI is a subcategory of return on investment or ROI, because here the cost is incurred on marketing.Description: Marketing a product could be expensive across various avenues available such as a website, social media, print, magazines, or hoardings. To gauge the effectiveness of the marketing campaign, companys resort to ROMI.	In simple terms, it is measured by calculating total revenues against marketing investment. It should only reflect the direct impact of a marketing campaign. For ROMI to be effective, it is important for the campaign to have some measured metrics.	The marketing manager should define the activities (quantified) that the end result will be measured with. They should also define the data which will be required to complete the analysis.	One basic formula for calculating the return on marketing investment is:	Gross Profit – Marketing Investment	--------------------------------------------------	Marketing Investment	Here the gross profit is the total revenue earnings and marketing investment is the total cost incurred on marketing across different mediums such as online, print, etc.	Let’s understand the concept with the help of an example. A company XYZ sells tables online. Before the campaign is displayed on various websites such as Urban Ladder, Pepperfry, etc., the company was generating revenues worth Rs 1,00,000 and the profit was Rs 20,000 – which means the cost was around Rs 80,000.	Now, the company launched its ad campaigns across websites and the revenue grew to Rs 1,25,000 in that particular month with a gross profit of Rs 25,000.	Campaign cost is Rs 4,000.	ROMI here would be = Incremental value – cost of campaign= 25,000-20,000-4,000 = Rs 1,000	ROMI is 1000/4000 = 25%"
65,0,Sales Promotion,"Definition: Sales promotions are the set of marketing activities undertaken to boost sales of the product or service. Description: There are two basic types of sales promotions: trade and consumer sales promotions. The schemes, discounts, freebies, commissions and incentives given to the trade (retailers, wholesalers, distributors, C&Fs) to stock more, push more and hence sell more of a product come under trade promotion. These are aimed at enticing the trade to stock up more and hence reduce stock-outs, increase share of shelf space and drive sales through the channels. However, trade schemes get limited by the cost incurred by the company as well as the limitations of the trade in India to stock up free goods. Incentives can be overseas trips and gifts.	A typical trade scheme on soaps would be buy a case of 12 soaps, get 1 or 2 free - or a 8% discount scheme (1/12=8%). Such schemes are common in FMCG and pharma industries. 	But sales promotion activity aimed at the final consumer are called consumer schemes. These are used to create a pull for the product and are advertised in public media to attract attention. Maximum schemes are floated in festival times, like Diwali or Christmas. Examples are buy soap, get diamond free; buy biscuits, collect runs; buy TV and get some discount or a free item with it and so on. Consumer schemes become very prominent in the 'maturity or decline' stages of a product life cycle, where companies vie to sell their own wares against severe competition.	The impact of sales promotions: Sales promotions typically increase the level of sales for the duration they are floated. Usually, as soon as the schemes end, the sales fall, but hopefully, settle at a higher level than they were before the sales promotion started. For the company, it can be a means to gain market share, though an expensive way. 		For consumers, these can offer great value for money. But sustained sales promotions can seriously damage a brand and its sales, as consumers wait specifically for the sales promotion to buy and not otherwise. Therefore, sales promotions are to be used as a tactical measure as part of an overall plan, and not as an end itself. "
66,0,Segmentation,"Definition: Segmentation means to divide the marketplace into parts, or segments, which are definable, accessible, actionable, and profitable and have a growth potential. In other words, a company would find it impossible to target the entire market, because of time, cost and effort restrictions. It needs to have a 'definable' segment - a mass of people who can be identified and targeted with reasonable effort, cost and time.	Once such a mass is identified, it has to be checked that this mass can actually be targeted with the resources at hand, or the segment should be accessible to the company. Beyond this, will the segment respond to marketing actions by the company (ads, prices, schemes, promos) or, is it actionable by the company? After this check, even though the product and the target are clear, is it profitable to sell to them? Is the number and value of the segment going to grow, such that the product also grows in sales and profits? Description: Segmentation takes on great significance in today's cluttered marketplace, with thousands of products, media proliferation, 	ad-fatigue and general economic problems around the world markets. Rightly segmenting the market place can make the difference between successes and shut down for a company. 	Segmentation allows a seller to closely tailor his product to the needs, desires, uses and paying ability of customers. It allows sellers to concentrate on their resources, money, time and effort on a profitable market, which will grow in numbers, usage and value. "
67,0,Strategic Business Unit,"Definition: A strategic business unit, popularly known as SBU, is a fully-functional unit of a business that has its own vision and direction. Typically, a strategic business unit operates as a separate unit, but it is also an important part of the company. It reports to the headquarters about its operational status.Description: A strategic business unit or SBU operates as an independent entity, but it has to report directly to the headquarters of the organisation about the status of its operation. It operates independently and is focused on a target market. It is big enough to have its own support functions such as HR, training departments etc. There are several benefits of having an SBU. This principle works best for organisations which have multiple product structure. The best example of SBU are companies like Proctor and Gamble, LG etc. These companies have different product categories under one roof. For example, LG as a company makes consumer durables.	It makes refrigerators, washing machines, air-conditioners as well as televisions. These small units are formed as separate SBUs so that revenues, costs as well as profits can be tracked independently. Once a unit is given an SBU status, it can make its own decisions, investments, budgets etc. It will be quick to react when the product market takes a shift or changes start happening before the shift happens."
68,0,Stratified Sampling,"Definition: Stratified sampling is a type of sampling method in which the total population is divided into smaller groups or strata to complete the sampling process. The strata is formed based on some common characteristics in the population data. After dividing the population into strata, the researcher randomly selects the sample proportionally.Description: Stratified sampling is a common sampling technique used by researchers when trying to draw conclusions from different sub-groups or strata. The strata or sub-groups should be different and the data should not overlap. While using stratified sampling, the researcher should use simple probability sampling. The population is divided into various subgroups such as age, gender, nationality, job profile, educational level etc. Stratified sampling is used when the researcher wants to understand the existing relationship between two groups. 	The researcher can represent even the smallest sub-group in the population. There are two types of stratified sampling – one is proportionate stratified random sampling and another is disproportionate stratified random sampling. In the proportionate random sampling, each stratum would have the same sampling fraction. For example, you have three sub-groups with a population size of 150, 200, 250 subjects in each subgroup respectively. Now, to make it proportionate, the researcher uses one specific fraction or a percentage to be applied on its subgroups of population. The sample for first group would be 150*0.5= 75, 200*0.5=100 and 250*0.5= 125. Here the constant factor is the proportion ration for each population subset. 	The only difference is the sampling fraction in the disproportionate stratified sampling technique. The researcher could use different fractions for various subgroups depending on the type of research or conclusion he wants to derive from the population. The only disadvantage to that is the fact that if the researcher lays too much emphasis on one subgroup, the result could be skewed."
69,0,Swot Analysis,"Definiton: SWOT stands for 'Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats'. This is a method of analysis of the environment and the company's standing in it.Description:	SWOT is made of two parts: the strengths and weaknesses refer to the internals of a company while the opportunities and threats are external to the company and exist in the environment. 	Strength of a company could be in managing the branding process quickly and comprehensively. Its weaknesses could lie in the distribution of products, or payment delays. These are internal problems / issues and have to be understood and dealt with on an ongoing basis. Often consultants are called in to assess these two aspects on the belief that an outsider could give more insights into the company. 	The two external factors, opportunities and threats, are not in the company's control. The environment, composed of social, economic, legal, regulatory, national and even international events, has to be continuously scanned to track these.	For example, an opportunity for a refrigerator company could be in freezers for ice cream; threats could be imports or the entry of new players with money and expertise. In a globalising world, opportunities can spring up anywhere, anytime, just as threats can come from any part or segment of global industry. "
70,0,Target Market,"Definition: Target market is the end consumer to which the company wants to sell its end products too. Target marketing involves breaking down the entire market into various segments and planning marketing strategies accordingly for each segment to increase the market share.Description: In simple words, not all products can be consumed by all customers and each product has a different set of consumers who want to purchase the product. In order to attract a particular segment of the market, the company at times, modifies the product accordingly. Creating the target market involves conceptualizing the product, understanding the need of the product in a market, studying its target audience etc. Target marketing would revolve around deploying marketing techniques for a particular segment of markets which could be key to attract new customers, expand business opportunities across geographies and expand distribution network to widen the reach. 	There are various steps involved in defining the target market. The first is to understand the problem of a customer whom you are addressing. Once it is done, the customers can be identified who are interested in that product. For example, you make water purifiers – so you address the problem of contaminated water quality. We know that farm houses do not have a regular water connection and the water they get from underground is hard. So, there is a wide opportunity for water-purifier makers to enter into this segment and tap the market. The next step is to understand your customer according to the region, income level, etc. Always think about the market, know your competition and the pricing of the product. It will help you in creating a benchmark. 	There are two important features, which the company should always consider before it decides to capture a separate market segment. First is the attractiveness of the segment, which means that it has less competition, high margin business etc. The second is that it falls in line with the company’s objective, vision etc."
71,0,Top Of The Mind Recall,"Definition: The image, sound, name, brand or attribute that comes to mind immediately when asked about products or brands in a category enjoys the highest 'top of the mind recall' with the consumer. Top of the mind recall usually means the consumer is more aware, and hopefully, buys more of the product than alternative products when faced with a vast array of similar products.Such products or brands have every possibility of lasting longer in the market place, giving the company a long revenue stream from it. A high top of the mind recall also helps in brand extensions. Every campaign by a client and advertising agency aims to create the top of the mind recall in consumers. Once recall is established, it's usually less expensive to advertise the product.Description: Sustained advertising to the public and trade creates top of the mind recall. Every media may be used - print, radio or TV. It can either be created by a vast and expensive advertising blitz or may be created over a long period of time, using limited resources and media exposure. But most importantly, selecting the right media for advertising goes a long way in creating top of the mind recall. For example, in rural areas, wall hoardings and paintings will be a better medium than newspapers. 	In today's age when the media channels have multiplied many times, creating recall is easier, but not always successful. For example, Coke and Pepsi advertise everywhere, anytime, anywhere, thereby equating soft drinks with their brand names. Endorsement by celebrities also creates top of the mind recall. However, just as top of the mind recall can be favourable for the product, it's just as easy to lose it to a competitor who is more aggressive or relevant. "
72,0,Trade Marketing,"Definition: Trade marketing is a wider marketing discipline that aims to increase demand with supply chain partners such as wholesalers, retailers, or at the distributor level, rather than just at the customer level.Description: Trade Marketing is also called B2B marketing or business-to-business marketing. All the promotional activities are aimed at increasing the demand of the product among the various supply chain partners.	By doing so, a manufacturer attempts to ensure the consistent supply and availability of the product to the end consumer. Incentives are given to the intermediaries for effective promotion of the product at their end.	Various forms of promotion at the retailer end include activities such as - ensuring prominent display of the product, branded merchandise, more shelf space, and even word of mouth also does the trick.	For products which doesn't require any human intervention for effective sale such as toothpaste, batteries, etc. (where alternatives of the product are more), here the manufacturer has to give some discounts, or better margins, some freebies to ensure availability of the product.	Trade marketing plays an effective part in sustainable brand development. To be more effective, market gurus have point out seven areas where the manufacturer should focus more for trade marketing to be effective.	For effective trade marketing, manufacturer should focus on	a) Promotion schedule (which could include time of sale),	b) Do lot of cross promotion of your own items,	c) Promotions should always be around a theme (Christmas, New Year, festivals etc.),	d) Communicate the value of the product to the consumer (how it stands as compared to competition),	e) Always plan in advance, and	f) Promotions should be aimed at growing the brand rather than just sales."
73,0,Unaided Recall,"Definition: Unaided recall is a marketing technique to determine how well a consumer remembers an advertisement without any external help such as clues, or visuals.Description: Unaided recall is a part of marketing research technique which is used to gauge the effectiveness of a brand when respondents are questioned about it without giving any clues. 	In unaided recall, a team of test audience is shown an advertisement and then quizzed about the brand. 	The effectiveness is gauged by the response that the tester gets from the respondents participating in the experiment. Usually, the questions asked in unaided recall are more open-ended.	For example, the moderator may ask the respondents to recall information about specific set of mobile phones which are known to have long battery life. Another example could be, ""Please tell me name of all smartphones which have a finger print scanner,""	If the respondents recognize your brand and lists out features which are specific to your brand it means that your marketing efforts are yielding results, which simply means that the marketing campaign is doing exactly what it should have done.	Unaided recall is slightly different from aided recall. Aided Recall is a tool to measure the effectiveness of the brand and its recall among the consumers when they are given cues."
74,0,Unique Selling Proposition,"Definition: Unique Selling Proposition or USP is the one feature or the perceived benefit of a good which makes it unique from the rest of the competing brands in the market. It is that very reason which motivates a buyer to purchase that product even though it might be costlier than other products.Description: Unique Selling Proposition or USP is a very important concept used during the time when a company promotes its product through its advertisements in both TV as well as print media which eventually attracts a consumer to buy a particular product. The key to boost the sales of the product effectively through advertising is to highlight the USP of the product prominently. Unless you highlight the USP, consumers will not be tempted to buy your product. Every product should have its own USP, which makes it stand apart from other products in the similar category. 	USP is different for different products. Let’s take an example of a restaurant which is very famous across the world for its quick Subway Sandwiches. The company makes the sandwiches healthier for consumers. Consumers who are looking for a quick meal can walk into any subway outlet and get a quick sandwich made, which contains nutritional value. In this way the company is able to create its own niche market across town in India. The USP of the product is a nutritious sandwich at an affordable price. USP is a very important component in developing the product. 	A strong unique selling proposition makes you stand apart and also plays an important role in branding your product. But, USP alone can guarantee to a product’s success. Superior product quality and at par service, both before and after-sale are very important in creating the foundations of a market for a product. Always remember, with a distinct USP, the company doesn’t even have to bother about competition because if you have developed something which has not been developed by others, then you are the only player or a market leader in that specific product category (Example – iPpod by Apple)."
75,0,Value Chain,"Definition: A value chain is the whole series of activities that create and build value at every step. The total value delivered by the company is the sum total of the value built up all throughout the company. Michael Porter developed this concept in his 1980 book 'Competitive Advantage'.Description: The significance of the value chain: The value chain concept separates useful activities (which allow the company as a whole to gain competitive advantage) from the wasteful activities (which hinder the company from getting a lead in the market). Focusing on the value-creating activities could give the company many advantages. For example, the ability to charge higher prices; lower cost of manufacture; better brand image, faster response to threats or opportunities.What is the value chain made of? Porter defines the value chain as made of primary activities and support activities. Primary involves inbound logistics (getting the material in for adding value by processing it), operations (which are all the processes within the manufacturing), outbound (which involves distribution to the points of sale), marketing and sales (which go sell it, brand it and promote it) and service (which maintains the functionality of the product, post sales).The support functions which feed into all the primary functions are the firm infrastructure, like MIS which allows managers to monitor the environment well; Human Resource, which develops the skills needed to steer the company well; procurement to buy/ source goods at the right price, which increasingly takes importance because of difficult economic conditions and technology, which could give the firm speed, accuracy and quality. Both these allow the firm to charge a margin, which partly comes from the value addition of the primary and support functions and partly from the advantage that the company gains due to communication of the value addition to the consumer (brand image, faith, trust and so on).Watch the video here:"
76,0,Viral Marketing,"Definition: Viral marketing refers to a technique in marketing a product or a service where users help in spreading the advertiser's message to other websites or the users create a scenario which can lead to multi-fold growth.Description: Viral in literal sense means anything which spreads fast (across users). This term is symbolically used in context with the web or mobile domain. Viral marketing is described as a marketing strategy which inspires users to spread or share the message to other users which can lead to multi-fold growth.	It could be a simple message on your smartphone related to a product which was recently launched, a news piece (example - India winning the world cup), or a YouTube video that individuals share with different users.	Hotmail was a classic example, but later Gmail took it to a new level, when it launched its free web-based email service. The email was by invitation only at first which helped create curiosity among the users.	But, when it was made live for everyone, most of the people migrated to Gmail to create their own free account. The users who got a Gmail account could then send an invite to other users to create an account, and the chain continued.	There are various elements required for effective marketing strategy which can make viral. Firstly, product or services should be 'free' for all, and should have easy accessibility. By doing this the marketing team is able to get enough attention from users across the globe, although it might not lead to any profit.	The next important element is the transferability part, which simple means that the message can be easily transferred or shared via email, WhatsApp, networking websites, etc. The message should be simple to understand and at the same time it should be short. Example - Get professional email for your business @yourcompany.com, 50GB of storage.	The other element is that the message should be interesting and intelligently placed. Users should be able to identify with the message. If any influential person (such as celebrity) endorses your message or product on the website or on their social media or networking site, it can become viral."
